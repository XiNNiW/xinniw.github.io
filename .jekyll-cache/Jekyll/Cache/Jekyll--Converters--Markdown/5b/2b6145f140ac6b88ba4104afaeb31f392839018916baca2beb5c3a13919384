<p>A DSF is an approximation of an ideal waveform (such as SAW or SQUARE) that uses trig identities to approximate the wave up to a given number of harmonics.</p>

<p>All periodic sound can be represented a <a class="internal-link" href="/fourier-series">Fourier series</a> of individual sine and cosine waves. This infinite series can be truncated to produce a wave with a given number of harmonics. (see: <a class="internal-link" href="/bandlimited-oscillator">Bandlimited Oscillator</a>) This truncated sum may have a ‚Äúclosed form‚Äù solution when trig identities can be used to reduce the sum to a single term. This makes it more efficient to implement than <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">

<p>Like the basic <a class="internal-link" href="/blit">BLIT</a> algorithm, DSF has limitations when it comes to smoothly changing/glissing frequencies the number of harmonics in a DSF formula is an integer value. When trying to render a <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">

<p>The following is a summary of an example presented in <em>Computer Music</em> by Dodge and Jerse:</p>

<p>A bandlimted pulse wave with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> harmonics can be constructed with the formula:
\(y(t) = \frac {A} {N} \sum_{k=1}^N cos(2 \pi kf_ot)\)</p>

<p>This sum can be reduced to the following ‚Äúclosed form‚Äù DSF:
\(y(t) = \frac {A} {2N} [\frac {sin((2N+1) \pi f_ot)} {sin(\pi f_o t)} -1]\)</p>

<p>An implementation using the bottom form will need to account for the case where the denominator goes to zero. For this case the formula above can be re-written with cosines:
\(y(t) = \frac {A} {2N} [\frac {(2N+1) cos((2N+1) \pi f_ot)} {cos(\pi f_o t)} - 1]\)</p>
