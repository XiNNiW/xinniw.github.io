<p>Strophic form is a folk song form that does not contain verses. It has one section of music. (typically labeled ‚ÄúA‚Äù) This section repeats with different lyrics for some number of verses before the song is over. The section may begin or end with a repeated refrain that serves to center the theme of the song. (ex. <em>This land is your land</em> by Woodie Guthrie, <em>Simple Twist of Fate</em> by Bob Dylan)</p>
