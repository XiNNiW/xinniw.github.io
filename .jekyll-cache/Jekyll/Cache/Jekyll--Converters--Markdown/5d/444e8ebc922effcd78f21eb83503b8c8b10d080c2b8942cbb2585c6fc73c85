<p>White noise is noise that is perfectly random. Ideal white noise has equal power in all harmonic bands and thus is impossible to physically create as it would take an infinite amount of energy.</p>

<p>Noise is said to be white when it has approximately equal power in all available frequency bands.</p>

<p>White noise may be filtered to produce other colors or noise such as <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">
  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>
  Pink noise]] and [[Brown noise
  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>.</p>
