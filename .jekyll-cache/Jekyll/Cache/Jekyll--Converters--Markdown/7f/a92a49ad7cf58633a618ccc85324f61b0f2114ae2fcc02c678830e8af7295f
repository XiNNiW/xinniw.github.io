<p>To me stereotypical pop song form is as follows. Verse - [Prechorus] - Chorus - Verse - [Prechorus] - Chorus - Bridge - Chorus. The first verse is sometimes twice as long as the second. It may also include an intro and/or outro section. It may or may not include a prechorus. The form is a little bit like a roller-coaster, with energy cresting at each chorus.</p>

<p>Newer pop songs frequently break out of this structure. (eg. <em>Sicko Mode</em> “Travis Scott”)</p>
