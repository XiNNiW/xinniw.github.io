<p>A non-causal filter is a digital filter that relies on future input values. (thus non-causal) It requires a system that has some latency to have future values in memory to work with. (it has no crystal ball) Non-causal equations can be used to model filters that would be impossible or too costly to implement as <a href="FIR filter">FIR</a> or <a href="[[IIR filter]]">IIR</a> filters</p>
