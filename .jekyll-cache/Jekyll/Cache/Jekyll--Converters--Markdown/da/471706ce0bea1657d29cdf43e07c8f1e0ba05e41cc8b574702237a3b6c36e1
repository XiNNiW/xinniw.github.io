I"<p>Getting very close to releaseing <strong>collective memory decay</strong>. Just finished with mastering and finalized some really cool cover art by Nellie Standsbury.</p>

<p>Shoutout to Tarekith at Inner Portal Studios for the mastering.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m really excited to share this with you!</p>

<p>Click <a href="https://xinniw.bandcamp.com/album/collective-memory-decay">here</a> to pre-save it on spotify.</p>

<p>You can also buy it on bandcamp <a href="https://xinniw.bandcamp.com/album/collective-memory-decay">here</a>. If you like what I do, buying my music on bandcamp is by far the best way to support me.</p>
