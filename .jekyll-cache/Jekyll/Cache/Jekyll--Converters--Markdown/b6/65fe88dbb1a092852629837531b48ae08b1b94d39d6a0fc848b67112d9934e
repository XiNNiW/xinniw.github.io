I"t<p>A while back I made a youtube video about making a whole track with nothing but sounds from an arturia microbrute synthesizer that I checked out from Ann Arborâ€™s district library. As part of making that track I made a whole bunch of drum sounds on it. Recently I stumbled on the files and thought I would share them in case they would be useful to anyone else in their productions.</p>

<p>If you want to play with the samples they are available for download here: <a href="/downloads">microbrute drum samples</a></p>

<p>The samples are licensed under the creative commons so do whatever you want with them. If you like using them consider supporting me on Ko-Fi.</p>
