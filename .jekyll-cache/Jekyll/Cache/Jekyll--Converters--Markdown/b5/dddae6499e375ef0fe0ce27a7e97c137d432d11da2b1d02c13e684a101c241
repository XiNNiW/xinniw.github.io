I"H<p>I checked out a microbrute from the Ann Arbor public library a while back and had a blast playing with it. I decided to try and make a whole track using just sounds designed on the microbrute. I filmed the result and put it on youtube.</p>

<p>It was fun to have a little challenge to work on as a starting point for a track and filming it somehow helped hold me accountable to finishing the result. I hope to make a bunch more of these in the coming year.</p>
