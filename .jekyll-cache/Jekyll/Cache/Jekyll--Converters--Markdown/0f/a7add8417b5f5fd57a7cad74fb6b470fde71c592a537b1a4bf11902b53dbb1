I"‡<p>A while back I made a youtube video about making a whole track with nothing but sounds from an arturia microbrute synthesizer that I checked out from Ann Arborâ€™s district library. As part of making that track I made a whole bunch of drum sounds on it. Recently I stumbled on the files and thought I would share them in case they would be useful to anyone else in their productions.</p>
