<p>A digital garden is a personal knowledge repository/website that allows its user to learn in public view by writing articles about topics that they learn. It can be explored by means of links and backlinks to other topics. It is an example of an online experience in the paradigm of a garden as opposed to the more ubiquitous stream paradigm that dominates modern web experience. (see: [[Garden vs. Stream dichotomy]]) The user may “wander the paths” of the garden finding unexpected connections. These connections foster learning as topics are expanded over time.</p>
