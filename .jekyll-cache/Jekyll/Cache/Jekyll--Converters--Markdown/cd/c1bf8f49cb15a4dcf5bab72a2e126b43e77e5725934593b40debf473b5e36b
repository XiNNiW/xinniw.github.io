<p>Strophic form is a folk song form that does not contain verses. It has one section of music. (typically labeled ‚ÄúA‚Äù) This section repeats with different lyrics for some number of verses before the song is over. The section may begin or end with a repeated refrain that serves to center the theme of the song. (ex. <em>This land is your land</em> by Woodie Guthrie, <em>Simple Twist of Fate</em> by Bob Dylan)</p>

<p>It excels at providing space for story telling as there is more room for new non-repeated words. In pop song form, there are also verses with unique lyrics but they comprise a smaller percentage of the song, as the chorus is typically repeated with the same words.</p>
