Getting very close to releaseing **collective memory decay**. Just finished with mastering and finalized some really cool cover art by Nellie Standsbury. 

Shoutout to Tarekith at Inner Portal Studios for the mastering.

I'm really excited to share this with you!

Click [here](https://xinniw.bandcamp.com/album/collective-memory-decay) to pre-save it on spotify. 

You can also buy it on bandcamp [here](https://xinniw.bandcamp.com/album/collective-memory-decay). If you like what I do, buying my music on bandcamp is by far the best way to support me.
