I checked out a microbrute from the Ann Arbor public library a while back and had a blast playing with it. I decided to try and make a whole track using just sounds designed on the microbrute. I filmed the result and put it on youtube.

You can check it out here: [weekly challenge 1 -- make a whole track using only a microbrute ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=562EmnuZkl0&t=3s)

It was fun to have a little challenge to work on as a starting point for a track and filming it somehow helped hold me accountable to finishing the result. I hope to make a bunch more of these in the coming year.
