A while back I made a youtube video about making a whole track with nothing but sounds from an arturia microbrute synthesizer that I checked out from Ann Arbor's district library. As part of making that track I made a whole bunch of drum sounds on it. Recently I stumbled on the files and thought I would share them in case they would be useful to anyone else in their productions.

If you want to play with the samples they are available for download here: <a href="<?phpecho $site->url."/downloads"?>">microbrute drum samples</a>

The samples are licensed under the creative commons so do whatever you want with them. If you like using them consider supporting me on Ko-Fi.
