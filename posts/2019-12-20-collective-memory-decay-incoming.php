Getting very close to releaseing <b>collective memory decay</b>. Just finished with mastering and finalized some really cool cover art by Nellie Standsbury.
</p><p>
Shoutout to Tarekith at Inner Portal Studios for the mastering.
</p><p>
I'm really excited to share this with you!

You can also buy it on bandcamp <a href="https://xinniw.bandcamp.com/album/collective-memory-decay">here</a>. If you like what I do, buying my music on bandcamp is by far the best way to support me.
