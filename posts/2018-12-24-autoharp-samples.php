My uncle recently gave me my grandmother's autoharp. I really love the instruments and think the strings sound super unique. I recorded each string and created a sample pack of the recordings so i could use them in tidalcycles and other tools that I use to make music.

If you want to play with the samples they are available for download here: <a href="<?php echo $site->url."/downloads"?>">lile autoharp samples</a>
The samples are licensed under the creative commons so do whatever you want with them. If you like using them consider supporting me on Ko-Fi.
