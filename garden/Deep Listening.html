<h1 id="deep-listening">Deep Listening</h1>
<p>:cc0:</p>
<p>Deep Listening is a compositional sound practice as well as a
meditation technique pioneered by composer Pauline Oliveros. She wrote a
book on the topic entitled "Deep Listening: A Composer's Sound
Practice". She also taught many workshops on the subject all across the
world. These have continued after her death.</p>
<p>The idea of Deep Listening is contained in the definition of the
title words. To listen is more than to merely hear. It involves
conscious perception of the sound and careful consideration of the
sound. It may also involve deciding what to do with the sound. Deep
describes the endless nature of this process of listening.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For me Deep Listening is a life long practice. The more I listen, the
more I learn to listen. - Pauline Oliveros</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deep listening practice, as described in her book, involves
intentional and often guided meditations on sound, journaling about the
experience of the sound, and composing/performing sound pieces. At
workshops these meditations are done in groups.</p>
<p>Written reflection on remembered sound is an important part of the
practice as it is such a good way of cementing what you notice and
learn.</p>
<p>Practice may also take the form of <a
href="Field%20Recording.html">field recording</a> and composing using
only the recorded sound.</p>
<p>Oliveros and others have created a variety of textual scores that are
designed to help a person have a Deep Listening experience.</p>
<p>My favorite (so far):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take a walk at night. Walk so silently that the bottoms of your feet
become ears. - Pauline Oliveros, <em>Sonic Meditations</em></p>
