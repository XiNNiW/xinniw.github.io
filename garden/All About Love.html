<h1 id="all-about-love">All About Love</h1>
<p>In All About Love hooks argues that we collectively experience a
crisis of lovelessness and that this is due in part to a
misunderstanding about what love is. She offers new visions of love and
synthesizes a new definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Act of will — to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing
one's own or another's spiritual development</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She defines spiritual as the union of mind and body — the wholeness
of a person.</p>
<p>This definition has profound clarity. Love is a verb. A choice. It
raises all kinds of interesting questions about what it means to act in
a loving way.</p>
