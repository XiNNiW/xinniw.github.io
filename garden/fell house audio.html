<h1 id="fell-house-audio">fell house audio</h1>
<p>fell house audio is the name I am giving to a project that will serve
as an outlet for both my music software/hardware engineering activities
as well as my music. I envision it as a community and a model for how to
sustain ongoing open source development and artistic development
simultaneously.</p>
<p>People who find value in the tools and artwork I produce could
subscribe to fell house audio to gain access to a member's only
community and to support ongoing development of the tools they use.
Subscribers would also have the ability to shape the direction of the
tool's development to suit their use cases. They would also get access
to my music output (if they want it). Additionally, they will get access
to behind the scenes content surrounding my creative process, work in
progress output, exclusive output, ect...</p>
<p>For some level, I would like to offer one on one guidance on the
kinds of creative practice that I might be able to help someone with
(music DSP, synthesis, composition, ect...)</p>
<p>Ideally, fell house audio would serve as a community for its members,
allowing discussion of artistic/creative practice and swapping
engineering techniques.</p>
<p>All software and hardware would be strong open source (copyleft).
However, for the initial experiment, the software would not be publicly
posted and no support would be offered. I would of course comply with
the terms of the GPL and give the source to anyone who asked for it.
Community members on the other hand would have builds created for their
platform and get guidance with using the source however they wished.</p>
<p>Maybe in time, if I can sustain myself, more and more can be offered
for free for anyone.</p>

<h3 id="maxpd-externals">Max/PD externals</h3>
<p>Externals offer a simple development cycle and a way to quickly
prototype ideas. These externals might shape the design of future
plugins/hardware modules.</p>
<p>I would like to create externals in the following areas:</p>
<h4 id="filters">filters</h4>
<ul>
<li>a variety of chaotic filters</li>
<li>high quality filters that you normally don't have out of the box in
max/pd</li>
<li>EQ filters</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="envelopes">envelopes</h4>
<ul>
<li>a variety percussive envelopes</li>
<li>a simple adsr, ad, asr implementation</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="oscillators">oscillators</h4>
<ul>
<li>feedback FM</li>
<li>phase modulation</li>
<li>bandlimited waveforms</li>
<li>experiments with arbitrary/random bandlimited waveforms using
POLYBlep</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="compressionsaturation">compression/saturation</h4>
<ul>
<li>components of compressors/saturators ready to go as externals</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="experimental">experimental</h4>
<ul>
<li>chaotic difference equations (Chua's oscillator)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="vocal-effects">Vocal effects</h4>
<ul>
<li>LPC based vocal synth</li>
<li>Autotune</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="chaotic-distorionfilterbanks">chaotic distorion/filterbanks</h4>
<ul>
<li>filterbank of chaotic filters</li>
<li>single chaotic filters</li>
