<h1 id="fm-synthesis">FM Synthesis</h1>
<p>:cc0: Frequency Modulation synthesis is a technique pioneered by John
Chowning. It is a synthesis technique where complex timbres are created
from simple tones by rapidly changing the frequency of the tone. If the
pitch is modulated at a rate where humans have pitch perception, audible
side-bands are generated. The main tone is called the carrier wave and
the tone that determines how fast to change the pitch is called the
modulator wave.</p>
<p>Many arrangements of modulators and carriers have been explored. Each
arrangement has its own timbrel possibilities.</p>
<p>Here is the typical equation for FM synthesis:</p>
<p>$ y(t)=sin(w_{c}t+Bsin(w_{m}t)) $ Where <span
class="math inline">\(w_{c}\)</span> is the carrier wave frequency,
<span class="math inline">\(w_{m}\)</span> is the modulator frequency,
and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the modulation index.</p>
<p>The index controls how deeply the modulator affects the pitch and
therefore also controls how harmonically rich the output is.</p>
<p>The modulation frequency is typically set to some ratio of the
carrier frequency. A simple relationship between these two typically
creates a more harmonic spectra. Weirder results can be had by detuning
this relationship.</p>
<h3 id="band-limiting">Band-limiting</h3>
<p>Although it is possible to predict the spectra of a FM oscillator
precisely (see Stanford's <a
href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/snd/fm.html">intro to
FM</a>), it is not generally feasible to strictly <a
href="Bandlimited%20Oscillator.md">band-limit</a> its output due to the
theoretically infinite number of side-bands. However, for many FM
architectures, the following rule of thumb can be used to limit the
value of the modulation index <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> in
order to make sure that aliasing will be minimal. In this way, it can be
<a href="Quasi-Bandlimited.html">Quasi-Bandlimited</a>. The rule of
thumb is as follows:</p>
<p>$ BW = 2f_{m}(B+1) $ Where <span class="math inline">\(BW\)</span> is
bandwidth, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the modulation
index, and <span class="math inline">\(f_{m}\)</span> is the modulation
frequency. For a given pitch, you can solve for the maximum allowable
bandwidth and then work backward to a maximum modulation index to limit
to for that note.</p>
<p>$ BW_{max} + f_{c} = \frac{f_{sr}} {2}$</p>
<p>$ B_{max} = \frac {BW_{max}} {2f_{m}} - 1 $</p>
<p>$ B_{max} = \frac{f_{sr}} {4f_{m}} $</p>
<p>In practice I've found that if that doesn't work, you can just divide
by a number larger than 4. This safety from aliasing will come at the
cost reducing the brightness of the sound and may not be appropriate for
all use cases. (eg. synthetic percussion)</p>
<h3 id="fm-operators">FM operators</h3>
<p>There are many ways to organize FM oscillators in relationship with
one another. Since Yamaha commercialized the algorithm in the 1980's, it
has been most common to organize them in terms of FM operators. An FM
operator is simply a waveform (often <span
class="math inline">\(sin\)</span>) multiplied by some envelope.
(typically ADSR)</p>
<p>$ op(t,modulators) = env(t)wave(wt+Bmodulators(t)) $ These operators
are then set to modulate each other in various ways. For example, the
following is a common arrangement that might be found on a Yamaha
synth:</p>
<p>$ op_{A}(t, op_{B}(t) + op_{B}(t) + op_{C}(t) + op_{D}(t)) $ The
envelopes allow different spectra to be animated over time. This can be
used in an attempt to model instruments like horns or simple explored on
its own terms.</p>
<p>This arrangement is very flexible but creates a lot of parameters to
control.</p>
<h3 id="feedback-fm">Feedback FM</h3>
<p>Even wilder timbres can be made by allowing an operator to modulate
itself. The basic idea is the same as regular FM except that the
modulator signal is the carrier signal delayed by 1 sample. Chaos is
easily achieved leading to noisy textures that make for good percussion.
At low feedback settings the system usually doesn't devolve directly
into noise but rather is made harsher and more aggressive by the
feedback.</p>
