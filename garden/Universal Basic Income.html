<h1 id="universal-basic-income">Universal Basic Income</h1>
<p>Universal Basic Income (or UBI for short) is a policy proposition
that everyone recieve some baseline salary simply for existing. This
salary would cover basic needs and ensure that no-one go without food,
shelter, or care.</p>
<p>Most current propositions call for the state to distribute this
funding.</p>
<p>There is a rightwing and leftwing version of UBI. The rightwing
version does not combine it with any regulation or accompanying
benifits. For example, health care would not be free and universal in
the rightwing version but rather left up to the market. This would
enable insurance companies and health care providers to appropriate the
entirety of the distributed funds for themselves — gouging prices as
high as they can. Regular people would not be freed from a choice
between wage slavery and destitution under this model.</p>
<p>The leftwing version of UBI combines it with universal health care
and other benefits. The phenomenon outlined above would still be a
concern. Anyone who has had to get a car repair after a stimulus check
will be familiar with the idea that if a seller knows how much you
received, their price will update accordingly. Still, if housing, food,
and health care are seen as rights. UBI could perhaps enable people to
live with considerably more freedom than we have seen in recent
memory.</p>
<h2 id="reproductive-labor">Reproductive labor</h2>
<p>We tend to glorify the work of factory workers when talking about
work. This is true on the left and on the right. We also tend to elide
compensation with value. Even corporate lawyers can be said to produce
something and since they are highly paid it must be important!</p>
<p>However, the most important work in society is often entirely unpaid.
This is the work of making, educating, and caring for human beings. This
work literally creates society. There is an important intersection with
feminism here: the reproductive work above is all stereotypically
considered "women's work" and devalued accordingly. It was feminist
scholars criticizing Marx who coined the phrase "reproductive
labor".</p>
<p>Service to caring labor is also ideally the point of all other work.
Why else create things unless we are serving a need — our own or someone
else's.</p>
<p>However, the way we think about value is backwards. We tend to think
that if something is highly paid it must be important. Often the
opposite is true. In <a href="Bullshit%20Jobs.html">Bullshit Jobs</a>,
Graeber argued that we are all aware of this to some degree and that it
causes us spiritual harm. Arguments about profit and value <em>beg the
question</em> in the sense of the phrase as describing a fallacy: money
is a measure of value therefore highly compensated work must be
valuable. When profit is allowed to become the measure of value all
sorts of insanity is possible: - the destruction of "surplus" goods to
control price - the financialization of the economy (ie the takeover of
the FIRE sector)</p>
<p>The dissonance we have around value and values often comes up when we
talk about education. I think it was Graeber that pointed out that we
talk about the value of education in shaping the workforce as if this is
the sole purpose of learning. We don't talk about the value of education
in making free human beings. This was the original meaning of liberal
arts — the education that a person needs in order to function as a free
member of society.</p>
