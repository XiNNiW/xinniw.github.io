<p>climb on the road you'll never make it alone falling It’s in the well
it’s in the weeds it’s all you needed</p>
<p>Carry (you've got it wrong, you've got it wrong) can you carry the
sun? can you carry (inside a song) our home?</p>
<p>Yesterday they flipped their shit and blew up pipelines</p>
<p>Carry (you've got it wrong, you've got it wrong) will you carry the
sun? will you carry (inside a sun) our home?</p>
<p>Carry (you've got it wrong, you've got it wrong) will you carry my
song? will you carry (inside a song) us home</p>
<p>You've got the names of everyone I know You come to mind I'm never
letting go Let out your sigh I've got a car to ride All jokes aside
We’re never going home</p>
<p>Carry (you got it wrong, you got it wrong)<br />
I want to carry the sun (inside a song)<br />
I want to carry our home</p>
<p>Carry (you got it wrong, you got it wrong)<br />
I want to carry the sun (inside a song)<br />
I want to carry our home (Beat faster)</p>
<h3 id="scraps">scraps</h3>
<p>There are these days where I forget to see the sun we're shaping
trees, we're shaping weeds to what we need</p>
