<h1 id="anarchism">anarchism</h1>
<p>It would seem antithetical to provide a single authoritative
definition for something like anarchism. Here is a list of different
definitions I've seen:</p>
<h3 id="graeber">Graeber</h3>
<p><a href="David%20Graeber.html">David Graeber</a> described himself as
an anarchist with a "small a". I interpret that as meaning being
inclusive to all those who wanted to operate without coercion. To me,
it's the idea that there isn't one right way to do it. Graeber also
insisted that anarchism is something that one <em>does</em> not just
something that one <em>believes</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When members of a group of people object to some form of domination,
and that causes them to imagine a world without it, and that in turn
causes them to reexamine and change their relations with each other …
that’s anarchy, whether or not you decide to pin a name on it and
whatever that name may be. - from <em>anarchy — in a manner of
speaking</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="leguin">LeGuin</h3>
<p><a href="Ursela%20K.%20LeGuin">Ursela K. LeGuin</a> wrote in her book
<a href="The%20Day%20Before%20the%20Revolution.html">The Day Before the
Revolution</a>: “What is an anarchist? One who, choosing, accepts the
responsibility of choice.”</p>
<h3 id="chomsky">Chomsky</h3>
<p>In a talk Chomsky gave in the 1980's he defined anarchists as people
who believe that coercive authority must be justified. He gives an
example of pulling his daughter out of the way of a speeding car. This
is a coercive intervention, however, hardly anyone would argue that it
was unjustified....</p>
<h3 id="kant">Kant</h3>
<p>According to Kant, Anarchy is a form of social organization that
allows for individual freedom, has a democratic rule of law, and that is
not predicated on violence. Kant dismissed this mode of social
organization as impossible. This is still the most common reaction to
anarchism from those who share this definition of it. anarchism is the
belief that such societies are possible and desirable.</p>
<h2 id="anarchism-vs.-democracy">anarchism vs. democracy</h2>
<p>Historically anarchists have been opposed to democracy, identifying
it as another form of rule. To be against rule was to therefor be
against democracy. To these thinkers, democracy always involved a
<em>demos</em> (a polity) enforcing its decisions through
<em>kratos</em> (power). Its not just that someone ends up getting
coerced here. Exactly who makes up the <em>demos</em> is historically
fraught. Power in a democracy is seen as legitimate only if it flows
from the people but when that power is used against people those getting
coerced typically are categorized outside the polity.</p>
<p>Some anarchists like to define anarchy as <em>true</em> democracy.
Thinkers like Graeber liked to do this by contesting the modern
conception of democracy as voting for representative. Graeber would
point out that the whole idea of voting was an aristocratic past time
and that democracy, in Ancient Greece at least, was conceived of as
direct democracy. Representatives were periodically chosen by partition
(ie drawing of lots).</p>
<p>Some, like youtuber Andrewism, take issue with this use of the word
democracy. He also argues that even direct democracy can constitute
unjustifiable rule over others.</p>
<p>I don't know if I really have an opinion here. I like Graeber's use
of the word as a rhetorical strategy. Democracy is used as a stand in
for ethical good. What precisely makes something a democracy is rarely
talked about. Graeber's use of the word makes it strange again and makes
me think about what it means to practice democracy and to what degree I
have ever experienced it. Considering that I don't think I've ever
participated in democracy and I don't live in one, I think it might be
worth a try. It certainly seems preferable to the current system.</p>
