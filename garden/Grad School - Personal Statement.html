<h1 id="personal-statement">Personal Statement</h1>
<p>I have always been attracted to both art and science but I have not
always felt that I belong in either. My development as an artist has
been defined by a determination to teach myself how to synthesize these
two parts of myself.</p>
<p>When I was young, despite being very interested in music, I struggled
with traditional music education and struggled to read conventional
music notation. As a teenager, I taught myself how to play guitar. I
started playing in a band, writing songs, and experimenting with sounds
on my parent’s computer.</p>
<p>When I entered college, I feared that studying music would be
inaccessible to me because I hadn't learned “properly”. Despite deciding
to major in Physics, I pushed myself to learn as much music as possible.
I joined the campus funk band, and took music classes including Music
Theory, Composition, and Jazz History. </p>
<p>In my second year, I took a class called “Composing With Computers”.
This class rocked my world and frustrated me intensely as it was the
only one like it offered. This class exposed me to Stockhausen, Ligeti,
and Chowning and pushed me to explore on my own. I discovered Autechre,
Laurie Spiegel, and Juan Atkins. It introduced me to the music
programming environment MaxMSP; in which I learned to compose
algorithmic music. In this medium, which fused technical and artistic, I
began to feel at home. As I worked to finish my physics degree, I
studied electronic music on my own. I began a habit that I continue to
this day: I taught myself software development by completing music
projects and taught myself composition by writing code.  I found a job
at software firm Menlo Innovations. I was able to thrive in Menlo’s
highly collaborative environment. I was challenged to become a leader in
a company that eschews hierarchy and prioritizes team success over
individual achievement.</p>
<p>I discovered the design team Hundredrabbits, whose work blends art,
technology, and sustainability. Gradually, I realized that this
intersection of sustainability and electronic music technology was
deeply important to me. I learned about the ecological cost of
computing, and how feature-rich, inefficient software often causes
computers to be replaced early in their useful life. In hopes of one day
building music tools that could run on old, low-powered machines, I
began to teach myself about the lower level details of making sound on
the computer. I began reading DSP textbooks for fun and decided to take
a yearlong, unpaid sabbatical from Menlo to focus on building my audio
programming skills. </p>
<p>Due to the climate and ecological crisis, the future of our society
will look very different from our present or our past. These changes
will not be isolated to any one portion of our lives but will rather
transform every aspect of our culture. This is why I want to study at
U-M: I want to contribute to a culture of electronic music that is
prepared to meet this future with all of its crises, disruptions, and
opportunities. </p>
