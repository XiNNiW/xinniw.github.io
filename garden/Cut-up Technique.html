<p>:cc0:</p>
<p>Pioneered by poet William Burroughs, cut-up technique is the process
of dissolving some corpus of text into its component words and
generating poetry from those words. This generated poem can be left as
is or subjected to further polishing and editing.</p>
<p>Burroughs would literally cut the words out with scissors and pull
them from a hat when constructing poems. Poets now also use computers to
assist them in creating cut-ups.</p>
<p>The generation techniques can be stochastic or deterministic.</p>
<p>The technique is popular with songwriters looking to surprise
themselves or play with language. Thom York, David Bowie, Robert
Pollard, and Jeff Tweedy are among some of the artists who occasionally
use cut-up technique in their writing.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a
href="pollard%20-%20cutup%20poetry%20assistant.html">program</a> to
assist me in creating my own cut-ups. I named it after Bob Pollard. It
creates a 1st order markov chain based on the corpus text and is
(mostly) capable of fitting its results to a predefined syllabic
scheme.</p>
