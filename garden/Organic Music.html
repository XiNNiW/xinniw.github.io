<h1 id="organic-music">Organic Music</h1>
<p>Organic Music is a concept invented by composer Julius Eastman that
defines a big part of his style. The idea is that each section of the
music contains all the information of the previous section. This
contrasts with the techniques of other "minimalist" composers who
usually create variation by operating on some repeated motif using a
process or procedure. In organic music, repeated material is elaborated
by guided improvisation which is repeated and then further elaborated in
response to the actions of the other musicians. The result is a kind of
spiraling effect that feels very different from the precise repetition
found in other minimal works.</p>
