<h1 id="permacomputing">Permacomputing</h1>
<p>Borrowed from the term [Permaculture], permacomputing is a branch of
computer science that seeks to make computational technologies that are
ecologically sustainable and immune from the disruptions that are
accompanying the climate crisis. Themes include: - highly efficient
software that is capable of running on old, low-power hardware - open
source software and hardware - resilient minimal operating systems
capable of being built for scavenged, improvised computers in the event
of a civilizational collapse. (see: <a
href="https://collapseos.org/.html">Collapse OS</a>)</p>
<p>The term was coined by demoscene artist
(viznut)[http://viznut.fi/texts-en/permacomputing.html], who has written
about it extensively.</p>
