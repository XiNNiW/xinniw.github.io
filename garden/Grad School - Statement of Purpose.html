<h1 id="statement-of-purpose">Statement of Purpose</h1>
<p>A few years ago, I had the opportunity to play a 1945 Gibson guitar
in a small Portland guitar shop. The shop had priced the instrument at
almost $15,000. Having no intention (or ability) of spending that kind
of money, I gingerly took the instrument down from the wall and began to
play it. It was the best guitar I have ever played. Each location on its
neck had changed the timbre in complex ways; a property that shiny new
Gibsons and Martins do not replicate. I find this instrument interesting
for the following reasons: 1. It has been a functional instrument for
over 70 years. 2. It had been repeatedly broken and repaired. 3. It had
acquired unique timbrel characteristics that would be difficult if not
impossible to replicate in a new instrument.</p>
<p>The vast majority of electronic instruments do not exhibit these
properties. I believe our electronic instruments are prevented from
developing the qualities above by a cycle of obsolescence and
replacement that is endemic to our society’s relationship with consumer
electronics. Given that the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions
and other ecological harm occurs in the material extraction and
manufacturing phases of the product life-cycle for electronic devices
(1), this cycle of obsolescence poses real danger as we attempt to
navigate compound climate and ecological crises. (2) I believe there is
an opportunity to create lasting cultures of electronic music that are
compatible with surviving the climate crisis and that the creation of
such cultures will serve as valuable working examples as we attempt to
transform all aspects of our society to meet our times. This is my hope
for studying in the University of Michigan’s Performing Arts Technology
department: that I might one day be able to contribute to the creation
of an electronic music permaculture.</p>
<h2 id="academic-and-research-goals">Academic and Research Goals</h2>
<p>When I borrow the word permaculture and apply it to electronic music,
I aim to describe a culture of electronic music that is compatible with
surviving the climate crisis and resilient against the disruptions
(economic, social, and physical) that are already accompanying this
crisis. In order to create this kind of permaculture, I believe that we
must work to make electronic instruments that last a long time, are
repairable/modifiable, built with technologies that respect the freedom
of their end-users, and maintained by communities of music intentionally
built to include and connect people from diverse backgrounds and
challenge systems of privilege. If an instrument can be easily repaired
and modified, it is much less likely to be replaced by a new instrument,
preventing the majority of ecological harm caused by its use. It is
essential for these instruments to be built with free (libre)
hardware/software as this allows for the end-user to have the rights
necessary to do what they wish with their instrument without risking
violating “terms of service” or other restrictions on repair or reverse
engineering. Adoption of these tools and practices will only be possible
through new communities that can provide support and educational
resources. Community is critical for maintaining knowledge surrounding
the repair of technology. Community is also critical for our resilience
against coming disruption. The current status quo (i.e. ignoring the
crisis) depends on ignoring or treating vast categories of people as
disposable. The community of a permaculture must then be as inclusive as
possible and seek to make meaningful relationships between people from
diverse backgrounds. Any of these aspects (longevity, freedom, and
community) is interesting in isolation but I believe all must work in
concert in order to be effective. The most inspiring example of this
kind of work, to me, is the birth of the Algorave scene. Algorave began
in the UK and grew from the TOPLAP society for livecoded music. A
portmanteau of algorithm and rave, the word Algorave describes a dance
party where performers improvise and execute musical code. The
instruments and culture that have formed around these parties also
combine the elements of electronic music permaculture that I named
above. Much of the software used in Algorave can be run on old or
low-power computers. All of the tools used by Algoravers are
open-source. Algoraves themselves, and the online communities that
surround them, have taken great pains to be intentional about what
behavior is and is not acceptable in the community. Careful moderation,
codes of conduct, and educational events that prioritize those who are
underrepresented, go a long way toward making all feel welcome and safe
at events. (4) This Algorave culture is attempting to intentionally meet
our moment, synthesizing culture and technology. I hope that by studying
and working in the Performing Arts Technology program at U-M that I can
contribute to further examples of permaculture through the following
means: by increasing by my skills (as an artist, engineer, and
musician), through direct exploration of the above topics through
projects and research, and most importantly, through dialogue with an
engaged and collaborative community of peers and mentors. Long-term
Goals I hope to one day make electronic instruments that will make
beautiful sound for 100 years or more and that my work will be useful to
those attempting to adapt our broader culture in order to ensure our
survival. Preparation I believe that the experiences of my life have
prepared me well for this course of study and that I have unique
experience and expertise to offer including professional software
development skills, mathematical background, and leadership experience.
As an undergrad, I majored in Physics. Physics taught me valuable
mathematical skills and problem solving methodologies. Despite never
being the most intuitive mathematician, I was able to compensate with
tenacity. I also studied music, taking courses in music theory,
composition, and jazz history. I was selected to take part in a
Ford/Knight research project that sought to make a review of the field
of Music Emotion and Neuroscience. Most importantly, I got the
opportunity to take “Composing With Computers”. In that class I was
exposed to a wide variety of electronic music, ranging from early
electro-acoustic and experimental work to rock, pop, and techno. This
class also introduced me to the music programming environment MaxMSP.
Exposure to MaxMSP simultaneously ignited a passion for software
development and generative music which I have pursued ever since. For
the past 7 years, I have worked at Ann Arbor-based software firm Menlo
Innovations. Menlo is a highly collaborative environment where
engineers, designers, and quality advocates work in pairs, sharing a
keyboard and mouse to accomplish their tasks. Menlo uses pairing to
facilitate transfer of knowledge through the team. This constant
knowledge transfer is a mitigation strategy for the business risk that
is incurred when any one engineer or designer becomes a “tower of
knowledge” concerning a particular project or technical skill. To ensure
that no individual becomes a “tower”, Menlo rotates pair partners every
week. Every month or so, one team member from each project is rotated to
a new project and is thrust into a new language or business domain. At
Menlo, everything you learn, you are expected to teach. When the team
notices that an individual has become an especially good teacher, they
may, by consensus, decide to promote that person. Team members at all
levels and roles participate in promotion, hiring, and (in the rare case
that it is necessary) firing team members. I thrived in this
environment. With the help of my peers, I was able to learn Test Driven
Development, Java, Javascript, Python, SQL, C#, and more. In addition to
Software Development, I was given the opportunity to try my hand at
Project Management, High-Tech Anthropology® (a role that is a cross
between UX researcher, designer, and business analyst), and business
culture change consulting. With the guidance and encouragement of my
teammates, I was able to quickly rise to a senior position in the
company and offer the team the unique ability to switch roles as
business demands changed. As a senior team member at Menlo, I was asked
to lead in an environment that eschews hierarchy and values the
performance of the team over individual performance. My performance was
measured based on my ability to raise up those around me. During the
annual “Tech Trek” event in Ann Arbor, I met Joe Bauer and Bill Van Loo.
Together, along with Nick Gaydos, Dan Blades, and Jason Engling, we
founded North Coast Modular Collective (NCMC). This organization, which
we are in the process of turning into a 501c3 non-profit, aims “increase
the skill, knowledge, and accessibility of electronic music artistry
through the development of music, instruments, and community.” We host
community educational events, provide opportunities for electronic music
performance, and design and build open-source music hardware. We are
currently designing an open-source modular hardware synthesizer called
the bridge system. The system is designed to be built at minimal cost,
by people with no prior experience in electronics. Each module gradually
increases the build difficulty providing a “bridge” to DIY synth
knowledge. We hope that this system, or components of it, could be used
in educational settings for students of all ages to increase the
accessibility to skills and tools of DIY and electronic music. So far,
we have completed beta versions of 6 modules in this system. In addition
to the projects that I have participated in with NCMC, I have completed
my own music technology projects, teaching myself basic digital signal
processing in C++ and completing a VST synthesizer plugin (Telegraph:
Chaotic Resonance Synthesizer) in 2021. Since being exposed to MaxMSP, I
have used music projects as a means to study programming and programming
projects as an excuse to study composition. In my spare time, I have
taught myself Pure Data, Supercollider, Tidalcycles and other music
composition and sound synthesis environments. I have also been active as
an artist, completing two albums as one half of the experimental pop duo
Mirror Monster, and two for my techno-based xinniw project. I have
regularly performed, playing at Dally In The Alley, Wayne State, The
Blind Pig, and the Ann Arbor District Library.</p>
<h2 id="community-impact">Community Impact</h2>
<p>My past experiences give me a unique perspective and a valuable set
of professional skills that would be useful in the aid of research
projects. I have strong skills as a software engineer, project manager,
and designer. I am as interested in the cultural aspects of music as
well as the technical and appreciate a wide variety of music. I love to
teach and collaborate. I thrive in environments where the success of the
team is valued more than the success of any individual. I would bring
all of these things to the community at U-M. Suitability of the Masters
In Music Technology As I began researching graduate school as a means of
furthering my goals in electronic music, I reached out to several
professors in the Performing Arts Technology department who were
gracious enough to meet with me to give me a better sense of the
program. In meeting with them, I was pleased to discover the following:
• passionate people who care deeply about, and genuinely seem to enjoy,
teaching • an open-minded community that appreciates work made in both
experimental and popular styles • a flexible program that often combines
engineering and research with multi-media musical composition and live
performance. Additionally, I found that faculty are conducting research
projects that I find fascinating. Of particular interest to me is Dr.
Gurevich’s research in instrument design, human instrument interaction,
and network-based musical experiences, Dr. Granzow’s research in
instrument design, digital fabrication, acoustics, and sound synthesis,
and Dr. Çamcı’s research immersive audio experiences, world-making, and
software design. Even in our short conversations, I gained valuable
insight and encouragement in my aims to build electronic instruments
that last and are sustainable. I believe that learning is best done in
community and I know that the community at U-M would be of great value
to me on my journey.</p>
