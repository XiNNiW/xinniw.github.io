<p>:cc0: Also called Test Driven Development</p>
<p>Test Driven Design (or TDD for short) is a methodology for software
design process where automated unit tests for a given function or module
of code is written before the production code is written. The process
works as follows: 1. Write a unit test that verifies the aspect of the
code's behavior you wish to add to the production module/function. 2.
Run it to verify it fails properly when that behavior is absent. (This
may involve adding enough production code for the test to compile). 3.
Write the smallest amount of production code necessary to get your unit
test to pass. 4. Repeat with new behavior.</p>
<p>This process is also known as Red-Green-<a
href="Refactor">Refactor</a> as you first get a test failure (Red), then
a test pass (Green), and then you may change the structure of your code
again (<a href="Refactor.html">Refactor</a>).</p>
<p>This process works very well when combined with <a
href="Pairing.html">paired programming</a>. The different stages provide
convenient moments in time to share the control of the keyboard and
mouse. The process of devising the test together is also an excellent
way to come to a shared understanding of the behavior you are both
aiming to create.</p>
<p>Although its is most widely known as Test Driven Development the
benefit of the practice is more clearly articulated by the name Test
Driven Design. Test writing is a process for understanding the code you
mean to write, sharing that understanding with the computer, and with
other humans.</p>
