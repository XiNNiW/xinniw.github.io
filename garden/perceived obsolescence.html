<h1 id="perceived-obsolescence">Perceived Obsolescence</h1>
<p>Perceived Obsolescence is when the manufacturer of some product
attempts to generate new sales through the marketing of new versions of
the same or largely similar product that bear some superficial changes
in look. This technique was pioneered by the American Auto companies who
discovered that you could get status obsessed people to shell out money
for a new car just by changing the colors of the models every year or
so.</p>
<p>This marketing psychology also applies to tech gadgets. This is
likely why apple periodically introduces colors for its produces.</p>
<p>I would posit that periodic UI "refreshes" that occur every few years
across all sorts of commercial software are attempts to generate a
feeling of perceived obsolescence in customers and motivate largely
unnecessary upgrades.</p>
