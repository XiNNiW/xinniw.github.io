<h1 id="referential-transparency">Referential Transparency</h1>
<p>:cc0:</p>
<p>Often discussed in conjunction with the paradigm of <a
href="Functional%20Programming.html">Functional Programming</a>,
Referential Transparency is the property of pure functions that always
guarantees the same return value for a given set of arguments. When a
function is pure, it has no side effects, and relies on only the values
of its arguments to determine the return value. This means that you will
always receive the same return value for a given set of arguments.</p>
<p>This property is extremely useful when: - <strong>Unit
Testing:</strong> Referential transparency enables "black box" testing
of a function or composition of functions. Cases are depended on only
input and output data, they require no mocking, and are generally more
simple to reason about. These tests only care about the implementation
details in so far as they effect the return value. - <strong>Designing
Code:</strong> The guarantee of consistent behavior makes it easier to
reason about the behavior of the code under a variety of circumstances
and isolates the code from the world of things that may fail or
misbehave. (eg. filesystems, Networks, other processes, ect...)
Additionally it makes it safer to compose the functionality of functions
together, which is helpful in designing more complicated algorithms from
simple parts. - <strong>Concurrency:</strong> Referential transparent
code never mutates outside values and instead deals with copies. In many
circumstances this makes it easier to share a data boundary with some
asynchronous concurrent process without resorting to mutex locks and
risking deadlock scenarios.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Referential Transparency is the most important
property of functional design and is also the most simple to translate
to languages that are not specially designed for functional programming.
It is possible to create referential transparent code that is not
dependent on specialized language features such as <a

href="Tail%20Call%20Optimization">Tail Call Optimization</a>, or <a
href="Lazy%20Evaluation.html">Lazy Evaluation</a>.</p>
