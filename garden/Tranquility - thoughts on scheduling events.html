<h1 id="tranquility-thought-on-scheduling-events">Tranquility: thought
on scheduling events</h1>
<p>One of the main responsibilities of the tranquility application is to
periodically query the user specified patterns and convert the resulting
events into osc messages. These osc messages contain the timing
information required by the SuperDirt synth to play them when they are
expected. The scheduling process repeats this operation every 1/20th of
a second - collecting all the events for that time period, converting
them to osc, and sending them over the network to SuperDirt (or other
synth target). In order to accomplish this we need the following: - a
clock (a way of scheduling functions in time) - a way of converting
patterns to osc message streams - a way of sending osc messages</p>
<h2 id="how-does-vortex-accomplish-this">how does vortex accomplish
this?</h2>
<p>vortex, in the <code>stream.py</code> file, implements a class called
<code>LinkClock</code>. <code>LinkClock</code> interfaces with the
AbeltonLink api for synchronising with external music applications.
Inside this class is a private method
<code>_notify_target_thread</code>. This method is spun off to a new
thread when start is called on the clock. It uses a thread sleep in a
while loop internally for timing. Each iteration of the loop
communicates the tempo via AbeltonLink and notifies subscribing streams.
The streams are then responsible for converting patterns to osc and
sending over the network to the Synth Target.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-strudel-accomplish-this">how does strudel accomplish
this?</h2>
<p>strudel, in the <code>Cyclist.mjs</code> file defines a
<code>Cyclist</code> class. This class collaborates with a clock
(defined in <code>zyklus.mjs</code>) to schedule events (called
<code>hap</code> in strudel) in time. On each tick of the clock, the
<code>Cyclist</code> queries its pattern and fires a function
<code>onTrigger</code> that is specified during construction by the
caller. In the <code>repl.mjs</code> file, a <code>Cyclist</code> is
created and an <code>onTrigger</code> behavior is specified. The
<code>repl</code> specifies an on trigger that then <code>awaits</code>
a function called <code>defaultOutput</code>. This function is passed
the event and the timing info when called. If the <code>context</code>
of the event contains an <code>onTrigger</code> function this is used
instead of <code>defaultOutput</code>. <code>defaultOutput</code> is
specified on construction of the <code>repl</code>. When the react
application that defines the web ide starts it sets defaultOutput to the
<code>webAudioOutput</code>. The web audio output directly uses the
events. In this configuration, no osc messages are produced. I believe
that strudel can be configured to communicate with SuperDirt over the
network as well and had osc classes in its library.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-tidal-accomplish-this">how does tidal accomplish
this?</h2>
<p>For mainline tidal, the <code>stream.hs</code> module defines the
following: - A data type called <code>Target</code> that contains the
network configuration for an OSC target. - A type called stream -
several functions for converting configuration data into
<code>IO Stream</code>. - several functions mapping
<code>Stream -&gt; IO</code>. These functions send OSC messages. -
<code>toOSC :: [Int] -&gt; ProcessedEvent -&gt; OSC -&gt; [(Double, Bool, O.Message)]</code>.
I think this is part of what converts events to OSC.
<code>ProcessedEvent</code> is some intermediate type.</p>

<p>Vortex might be easier to imitate at first as its implementation is
simpler. Added complexity could be layered in later. The project already
makes use of <code>LuaSocket</code> as part of its dependence on
<code>losc</code> for sending osc messages. (This might need to be
revisited as vortex uses <code>liblo</code>. It might be best to attempt
to use the same libraries as others when possible. )
<code>LuaSocket</code> provides a sleep method
<code>socket.sleep(time)</code>. Perhaps coroutines could be used to
spin up a clock process that sleeps internally this way to create the
1/20 sample rate for querying patterns. A function for converting events
to osc messages will need to be created.</p>
<h3 id="coroutines">2023-02-02 - coroutines</h3>
<p>Co-routines are a pattern for accomplishing cooperative multitasking.
In cooperative multitasking, the program never cedes control of its run
to an external party and concurrency is accomplished by explicit task
switching in the program. Co-routines (cooperative routines), are
sub-routines that can suspend their operation and <em>yeild</em> program
flow back to the caller without returning. The caller can then
<em>resume</em> the co-routine until it completes or <em>yeilds</em>
again. This trades away the ability for true parallelism for more
determinism is program flow while still providing concurrency.</p>
<p>If tranquility is going to use this style of concurrency to
accomplish multitasking between pattern parsing and sending osc
messages, there will need to be some explicit part of the program in
charge of this task switching. What if there were a scheduler process
that switched between these two tasks? How could the tasks be defined?
The clock/osc message process is more clear. There is a method on the
subscribing <code>Stream</code> that is called by the publishing
<code>Clock</code>. The <code>Clock</code> could return a co-routine
when started that a <code>Scheduler</code> could repeatedly call. What
about the other half of the tasks? How can the process of stream
creation be defined as a co-routine that is called by this scheduler.
Right now there is a global function <code>p</code> that adds processes
to a global <code>Stream</code> map and starts the clock. These pieces
of state (<code>Streams</code> and <code>Clock</code>) would need to be
managed by the scheduler. But where does the user input come from that
calls <code>p</code>? Could some <code>DSL</code> context be exported
that would poll for new user input and then <code>yeild</code>? This
would mean that there would be a good deal of busy-waiting... is there a
better design that utilizes co-routines? Is it better to try an
accomplish true parallelism?</p>
<p>For tomorrow, I should try and make a lua script that makes a pattern
<code>Pure("gabba")</code> and starts a clock with a stream of this
pattern. Hopefully, this will create a distorted kick drum once per
cycle and we will be at "gabba zero". <em>:)</em></p>
