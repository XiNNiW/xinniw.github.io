for Music</h1>
<p>What would a sustainable environment for computer music look
like?</p>
<p>It would have to balance the following constraints: - Portability to
a large variety of old and scavenged hardware - Enough precision to
achieve acceptable sound complexity - Enough speed to render multiple
voices of sound and complete audio editing and sound design tasks</p>
<p>The goal would be to make an instrument that one would be happy
playing for the rest of one's life. This property is expected of
violins, guitars, pianos and other traditional instruments. How could
this property be extended to digital instruments? This is a larger
question with many cultural, and sociological implications. For now lets
explore the simple technical questions. A digital instrument like the
one described above would have to balance novelty, and quality against
hardware that are as limited as possible. The more limited the hardware
specifications targeted, the more likely this instrument will be able to
be emulated far into the future on whatever hardware is available. It is
important here to specify what <a
href="model%20of%20future%20computing.html">model of future
computing</a> one wishes to use. For example, should this digital
instrument be designed to weather a total collapse of the supply chains
that make computers possible? Should it instead model a future defined
by a literal interpretation of Moore's Law and assume that future
hardware will be faster, better, and therefor capable of emulating any
system designed now?</p>
<p>These constraints are obviously in tension with each other. An
acceptable polyphony of voices using high sample rates and large bit
depths requires fast processing speeds. Powerful sampling capabilities
and large numbers of tracks require large amounts of RAM. Finally the
GUI environment that popular music software runs inside of has become
more resource intensive. At first glance it seems like the modern
concept of a DAW really only became possible with the advent of SIMD
instruction sets. If this is set as a requirement, it severely limits
portability to older hardware. However, I'm not so sure that these high
flying specs really are required in order to make a computer instrument
that one could happily spend the rest of their life playing.</p>
<p>I believe it is possible to create a digital instrument flexible
enough for many lifetimes of exploration within fairly modest
computational limits.</p>

<p>It may be useful to look at historical music software and think about
its minimum operating specs and the breadth of features offered within
those limitations.</p>
