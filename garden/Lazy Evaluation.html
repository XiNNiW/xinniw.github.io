<h1 id="lazy-evaluation">Lazy Evaluation</h1>
<p>:cc0:</p>
<p>Many functional languages enable code to be evaluated lazily by
default. This means the code is not executed until the moment when the
final return value is needed for interaction with the outside world.
This enables functions to manipulate otherwise impossible data
structures, such as infinite lists, so long as, by the time the final
call is made, the functions are composed in such a way the limits the
size of the data. Lazy evaluation pairs well with closures and partial
application in enabling the programmer to compose functionality
together.</p>
