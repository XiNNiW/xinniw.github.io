<h1 id="blit-band-limited-impulse-train">BLIT (Band-Limited Impulse
Train)</h1>
<p>BLIT is an algorithm for creating band-limited waveforms first
outlined in the paper <em>Alias-Free Digital Synthesis of Classic Analog
Waveforms</em> by Julius Smith and Tim Stilson. (paper available <a
href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~stilti/papers/blit.pdf.html">here</a>)
It can be used to generate a wide variety of waves but excels at
reproducing the forms that are typically found on analog synthesizers.
(eg. Saw, Square, and Triangle) The algorithm focuses on first creating
a band-limited pulse wave. An ideal pulse wave contains frequency energy
is all bands, and therefor can be filtered down to produce all other
waveforms.</p>
<h2 id="the-algorithm">the algorithm</h2>
<p>An approximate pulse is designed by using a sinc function whose
harmonic content does not exceed 1/2 of the Nyquist frequency. This
means that all filtered waves will also be band-limited.</p>
<p>These Impulses are sometimes stored in a table of BLITs to optimize
performance.</p>
<p>A filter is then designed that will transform the pulse into another
wave. Often this filter carries out one or several integration
operations. For example, with one pass of an integrator the pulse
becomes a saw wave.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">limitations</h2>
<p>The initial pulse wave is dependent on the fundamental frequency of
the desired note and is only capable or generating some integer number
of harmonics above this fundamental. The algorithm typically sets this
integer number of harmonics to the maximum number that would not alias.
As the pitch rises, harmonics are removed one by one as they pass the
1/2 Nyquist threshold. This step-wise removal of frequency can cause
audible zipper noise on a glissando. For sounds that can smoothly gliss
in pitch other algorithms are required.</p>
<p>Other modulations of the sound are not smoothly handled by that BLIT
algorithm along. For example, hard-sync, commonly found on analog
equipment, introduces modulation of the underlying pulse that would not
be possible with BLIT alone. (see <a
