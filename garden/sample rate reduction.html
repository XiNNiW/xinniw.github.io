<h1 id="sample-rate-reduction">Sample Rate Reduction</h1>
<p>Sample rate reduction is an audio effect where the audio signal is
deliberately under-sampled so as to produce in-harmonic <a
href="aliasing.html">aliasing</a> distortion and limit the maximum
frequency.</p>
<p>It is sometimes implemented as a kind of sample and hold operation on
a digital signal. Imagine an audio processing block with 2 inputs. The
first is the signal and the second is the trigger. A trigger signal will
either cause the block to pass the first signal along or continue
outputting the signal value from the last time the trigger signal was
high. If the trigger signal repeats at some frequency lower than the
sampling rate, the result will be that the audio is resampled at that
frequency. If the source audio contains frequency components higher than
1/2 the trigger signal's frequency then those components will alias and
show up in the output as in-harmonic side-bands.</p>
<p>It also has the effect of lowpass filtering the signal as frequencies
higher than 1/2 the trigger signal's frequency cannot be represented in
the resampled output.</p>
<p>TODO: implement this in algae and show the implementation here.</p>
