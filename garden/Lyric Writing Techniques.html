<h1 id="lyric-writing-techniques">Lyric Writing Techniques</h1>
<p>Below are various exercises for writing lyrics that I have found
useful as a starting place when I'm stuck. Some are exercise to practice
various parts of writing and to help you not get stuck. Others are
methods for, as Jeff Tweedy puts it in <a
href="How%20to%20Write%20One%20Song.html">How to Write One Song</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hot-pen">Hot pen</h2>
<p>Set a timer. Write until the timer runs out. Do not let yourself stop
until the timer is done. Write nonsense if you have to.</p>
<h2 id="begin-each-line-with-the-last-word-from-the-previous">Begin each
line with the last word from the previous</h2>
<p>This works well in conjunction with hot pen. Try to make a line that
starts with the last word of the prior line. This create an artificial
sense of continuity and may reveal relationships between ideas that you
have not previously considered.</p>
<h2 id="cutup-technique">Cutup technique</h2>
<p>see [[Cut-up Technique]] for more.</p>
<h2 id="transcribe-a-conversation">Transcribe a conversation</h2>
<p>I learned this in Jeff Tweedy's <em>How to Write One Song</em>, which
is excellent. Record or recall a conversation you had with someone or
one you overheard. Adapt lines from the conversation as song lyrics.</p>
<h2 id="nounverb-ladder">Noun/Verb ladder</h2>
<p>This is also from Jeff Tweedy's <em>How to Write One Song</em>. Pick
10 nouns and 10 verbs. Create 10 lines that combine nouns and verbs that
aren't used together often. This helps make lines that are surprising or
striking. Take the best of these as a starting point for lyrics.</p>
<p>Related to [[Cut-up Technique]] and combines well with it.</p>
<h2 id="the-dreaded-adjective">The Dreaded Adjective</h2>
<p>From Jeff Tweedy's <em>How to Write One Song</em>. Pick 10 adjectives
and 10 nouns/verbs. Create 10 lines that combine adjectives and
nouns/verbs that aren't used together often. This helps make lines that
are surprising or striking. Take the best of these as a starting point
for lyrics.</p>
<p>Related to [[Cut-up Technique]] and combines well with it.</p>
<h2 id="adapt-a-poem-you-like">Adapt a poem you like</h2>
<p>Use a poem as a jumping off point. Adapt lines from the poem as
lyrics. You can use these just to get a sense of the rhythm and flow of
the song and then replace them with your own ideas. You may also choose
to keep them. However, if you keep the adapted lines, indicate that the
song is an adaptation of their poem and, if they are alive, ask their
permission.</p>
<h2 id="mumble-translation">Mumble Translation</h2>
<p>Record yourself singing nonsense over a track. Listen to the result
and try to transcribe what was sung. If you like what you have, keep it.
If not, what other words could fit that structure?</p>
<h2 id="auto-complete">Auto complete</h2>
<p>On your phone, type a random word that pops into your head. Accept
the auto suggested words. Change the sentence to make it make sense to
you.</p>
<h2 id="spell-check-suggestions">Spell check suggestions</h2>
<p>Type gibberish... use a spell check system like vim's
<code>:spell</code> to auto suggest words. Change the sentence to make
it make sense to you.</p>
