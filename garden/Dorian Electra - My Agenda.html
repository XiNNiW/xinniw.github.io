<p>This record rocks and I'm fascinated by it. There is so much for me
to learn here. Their songwriting is excellent. Each song, perhaps with
the exception of the title track, takes the perspective of some
character with a fucked up sense of masculinity and explores what's
toxic about that view of gender. The first track, <em>Fuck The
World</em> takes the perspective of and incel and uses language common
on incel forums to flesh out this character while ripping into that
worldview. Its fucking funny as hell and well written. The track uses
metal double kick drums, emo harmonies, massive amounts of autotune.</p>
<p>Barbie boy inhabits a man who cares only about his looks and how he
is perceived by his partner. The bridge melts into a darker harmony and
explores what would happen if this superficial value fades:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plastic is perfect but plastic will melt in the sun You keep me and
use me and throw me away when you're done You say that you need me but
treat me like I'm just a toy But till then you know that I will be your
Barbie boy</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sorry Bro (I love you)</em> inhabits a man who is in love with
his (male) friend but who can't say it because of unstated homophobia.
Its skewering this common and casual homophobia that straight men often
act out (ie. "no homo!") and strongly implies that it might originate
with feelings that they are uncomfortable with having because of their
prejudice. Its hilarious and also sad and touching. The love described
is sincere and sweet and I find it terribly sad that this character
can't let that feeling out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sorry that I need ya You know I always wanna be there for you Sorry,
didn't mean it, I love you Sorry bro, I love you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of these songs are pop perfection/confection. Big bouncy
eurodance synths. Great harmony. Big buzzy bass and kickdrum hits. Great
fucking melodies.</p>
<p>The remixes on the record are even better than the record which I
really appreciate. The anamanagucci remix of <em>My Agenda</em> is an
enormous glitter storm complete with a wholestep key modulation, a
screamo breakdown and beautiful jazz chords rendered in video game chip
tune synths.</p>
