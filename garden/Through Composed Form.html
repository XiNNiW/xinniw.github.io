<h1 id="through-composed-form">Through Composed Form</h1>
<p>When a piece of music is through composed its form does not contain
repetitions. In pop and folk songs this allows for internal repetition
of musical ideas but not for repetition of whole sections. An example of
a through composed form would be the following: <code>A-B-C-D</code></p>
<p>Some songs with through composed forms: <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> by
Queen <em>In Dreams</em> by Roy Orbison <em>Sicko Mode</em> by Travis
Scott <em>Paranoid Android</em> by Radiohead</p>
<p>Through composed form can give a track a dreamlike sense of
wandering. Each section is like a scene or a room, different from the
last one, but similar enough to be familiar.</p>
<p>My favorite through composed songs make heavy use of internal
repetition for at least some sections. If both the form and the musical
ideas float, its too much floating for my taste.</p>
