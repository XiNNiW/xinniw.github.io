<h1 id="tracker">Tracker</h1>
<p>A tracker is a metaphor for music software where musical events are
represented as pages containing matrices of values. Time flows
vertically with the earliest events in the pattern at the top of each
page. Trackers were a more common software metaphor in the 90s and
played an instrumental role in the development of jungle, drum and bass
as well as many videogame scores.</p>
