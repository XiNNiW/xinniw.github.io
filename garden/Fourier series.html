<p>:cc0: Fourier's theorem states that any periodic function can be
approximated perfectly by some weighted sum of harmonic sine and cosine
waves. This sum is often infinite. (see: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series.html">wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>Arbitrary signals can be analyzed to determine the weights for the
Fourier series that approximates them. This kind of analysis can be used
to transform a [[Time Domain]] signal into a [[Frequency Domain]]
signal. This transformation is the first step in a variety of [[Spectral
Processing]] algorithms.</p>
<p>In calculus this is represented by the [[Fourier Transform]]. For DSP
and digital audio a variety of [[Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)]]
algorithms exist. Some of these algorithms can operate in real time.</p>
<p>Since Fourier's theorem only holds for signals that are perfectly
periodic (ie. signals that repeat exactly forever) these transform
algorithms often slice an input signal into "windows". Each window is
assumed to repeat forever so that the frequencies present in each window
can be derived by computing the Fourier transform. This "windowing"
operation is a source of error and is an example of an [[orthogonal
property]]. The more you know about the signals what frequencies are
present in a window (ie. a larger window size), the less you know about
<em>when</em> those frequencies occurred in the time domain.</p>
