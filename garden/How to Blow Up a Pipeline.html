<h1 id="how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline">How to Blow Up A Pipeline</h1>
<p><em>How to Blow Up A Pipeline</em> is a book written by Andreas Malm
that asks the question: given the gravity of the climate crisis, why
have we not seen violent protest against those who perpetuate it? Malm
does not spend much time attempting to answer this question but rather
makes a moral and tactical case for the value of violence (in particular
property destruction) in fighting climate change. It's an occasionally
frustrating book with many brilliant moments and more than a few
important insights. Its moral arguments, while solid, are disorganized
across its 3 sections. Ultimately, the books fails to deal with the most
interesting ramifications of the questions it poses. Among the areas I
would have liked Malm to address in more detail are: - The dearth of
social imagination in the Global North, the sources of this imaginative
deficit, and how to restore our collective imaginative capacity. - An in
depth tactical analysis of how property violence and the potential
consequences of its use. He is clear that violence, even property
violence, has the potential to backfire and fuel opposition to a
movement. How this might happen, and under what conditions, is primarily
left as an exercise for the reader. This is irresponsible as the book
openly advocates for the tactical destruction of property as a means to
ending the climate crisis.</p>
<p>The book is split into 3 sections: 1. Learning From Past Struggles 2.
Breaking the spell 3. Fighting Despair.</p>
<h3 id="learning-from-past-struggles">1. <em>Learning From Past
Struggles</em></h3>
<p>In the first section Malm sets the stage by emphasising the what is
at stake in the climate crisis (death at an unimaginable scale, and
potentially the survival of the species). Given this gravity, why has
the mainstream movement (XR, 350.org, ect...) maintained an exclusively
non-violent strategy?</p>
<p>Lancaster paradox</p>
<p>The commitment to exclusively non-violent tactics and a refutation of
arguments commonly made by those who subscribe to exclusively
non-violent tactics.</p>
<p>A short historical summary of successful "non-violent" social
movements. (spoiler: they all used violence at some point often to great
effect)</p>
<h3 id="breaking-the-spell">2. <em>Breaking the spell</em></h3>
<p>More historical uses of violence. Destruction of fossil fuel
infrastructure by social movements in the Global South. Malm notes that
none of the social moments mentioned here destroyed fossil fuel
infrastructure due to the infrastructure role in the climate crises.
These movements rather targeted this infrastructure due to its strategic
importance to their opponents. Malm briefly wonders aloud why there have
not yet been climate movements in the Global South that make use of
infrastructure sabotage as a tactic.</p>
<p>Arguments for combining class conciousness into climate protest and
using property violence against the wealthy as a means of climate
protest.</p>
<p>Anecdotes about sabotage the author has used. (This section also
contains the oddity of Malm noting that his activist group referred to
themselves as the "Indians of the Concrete Jungle" and that they had
been contacted by "a Native American" who told them that this name was
culturally appropriative. Malm falls short of really reacting to this
criticism and uses the name Indians to refer to activists for the next
several pages.)</p>
<p>A section distinguishing violence from terrorism and property
violence from general violence as separate moral categories that should
be treated differently. He makes a case against using terrorism or
physical violence against human beings. He also constrains the targets
of useful property violence to the luxury toys of the wealthy and fossil
fuel infrastructure. This is the crux of his moral argument.</p>
<p>A short section on the lack of imagination about social possibilities
in the global North and how this makes creating compelling social
movements more difficult.</p>
<p>A brief moment where Malm wonders aloud about the potential
retaliatory action that the State make take in response to effective
sabotage. An anecdote about 2 US climate activists who ended up in jail
with a 110 year sentence for poking holes in the Dakota Access Pipeline.
Malm fails to address all the potential consequences of the State
response. He pretty much leaves it at "well you weren't expecting this
to be easy were you?".</p>
<h3 id="fighting-despair">3. Fighting Despair</h3>
<p>Taking Jonathan Franzen and Roy Scranton to task for advocating for
despair and resignation in the face of the crisis. He argues that their
views are unscientific and lack imagination.</p>
<p>A short section on environmental property violence in the 90's by
groups such as EF!, ALF, and ELF. He criticises the ideological roots of
these movements, which like Scranton emphasize despair but draw
different conclusions. The ideology of these movements assume that it is
not possible to change society in a way compatible with surviving the
crisis and espouse solutions that range from primitivist (return human
beings to a pre-industrial state of hunter gatherers) to eco-facist
(limit the earth's human population to 600,000 people). Malm dismisses
this ideology as being unscientific, facist, and trapped in despair. He
then focuses on the violent tactics these groups employed. He comes to
the conclusion that these groups did not accomplish much with their
activism. Their violent acts were alienated (by their own elitism) from
the context of a larger movement that would have potentially given them
meaning.</p>
<p>A section refuting despair as inappropriate and counter-productive.
Malm argues that, no matter how far the crises progresses, action that
makes future survival more probable is always worthwhile.</p>
