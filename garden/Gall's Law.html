<h1 id="galls-law">Gall's Law</h1>
<p>"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from
a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch
never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start
over with a working simple system." - John Gall</p>
<p>John Gall was a systems thinker and paediatrician operating out of
Ann Arbor Michigan. He wrote several influential books about systems
design. He is a big influence on Rich Sheridan and James Goeble. At
Menlo Innovations, we had Gall's law printed on a wall in giant
font.</p>
