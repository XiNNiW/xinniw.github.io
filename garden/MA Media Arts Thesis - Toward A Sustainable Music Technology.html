Music Technology/ Un-alienated Music Technology</h1>
<p>What follows is a very early idea for my thesis... I will update this
page with my actual paper</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You can go home again, the General Temporal Theory asserts, so long
as you understand that home is a place where you have never been." ―
Ursula K. Le Guin, The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="music-technology">Music Technology</h2>
<p>I am an artist and a technologist. I create and practice art - music
mostly. I also create tools to create music with. I love both of these
practices. For me, they are deeply intertwined.</p>
<p>Livecoding/Algorave Eurorack synthesizers Drum machines and hardware
synthesizers Laptop based production</p>
<p>I want to base my investigation of sustainable ICT in music
technology because its what I know best and its technology that I don't
wish to live without. I could go the rest of my life without attending
another zoom meeting, or reading another tweet. I don't know if I can
say the same for playing with synthesizers.</p>
<h2 id="false-dichotomies-in-technology">False Dichotomies in
Technology</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Technology is the active human interface with the material world.
But the word is consistently misused to mean only the enormously complex
and specialised technologies of the past few decades, supported by
massive exploitation both of natural and human resources.” - Ursula K.
LeGuin, A Rant About Technology</p>
</blockquote>
<p>LeGuin wrote the above in an essay she published in response to a
reviewer who had accused her of only writing "soft" science fiction.
Soft meaning non-technological. The review went as far to say that
"technology is carefully avoided" in LeGuin's work. Of course, LeGuin's
work contains plenty of technology - just not the kind the reviewer had
in mind. LeGuin's response points out this common substitution that is
made when discussing technology. "Hi-tech" is taken as a stand in for
all technology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We have been so desensitized by a hundred and fifty years of
ceaselessly expanding technical prowess that we think nothing less
complex and showy than a computer or a jet bomber deserves to be called
"technology " at all. As if linen were the same thing as flax — as if
paper, ink, wheels, knives, clocks, chairs, aspirin pills, were natural
objects, born with us like our teeth and fingers -- as if steel
saucepans with copper bottoms and fleece vests spun from recycled glass
grew on trees, and we just picked them when they were ripe... One way to
illustrate that most technologies are, in fact, pretty "hi," is to ask
yourself of any manmade object, Do I know how to make one? "</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This false dichotomy between high and low technology is incredibly
problematic. As LeGuin points out, the past centuries relentless pursuit
of every "higher" technology has had devastating consequences on our
shared ecology.</p>
<h2 id="problem-space">Problem Space</h2>
<p>Studies estimate ICT accounts for <sub>1</sub>.8-2.8% of global
emissions. Recent studies increase that estimate to <sub>2</sub>.1-3.9%.
These emissions are estimated to increase. (Widdicks et al. 2020)</p>
<p>Aviation accounts for <sub>2</sub>.5-3.5% of global emissions.
(Richie 2020)</p>
<p>We are used to thinking about emissions that occur through use. Our
appliances used to more or less work this way. The emissions that result
from building a refrigerator are dwarfed by the emissions from running
it all day every day. ICT does not follow this pattern. The lion's share
of the emissions from the use of computers are from the manufacturing
process and the material supply chains that said manufacturing relies
upon. Computer's give the illusion of being "clean" because the massive
ecological expenditure needed for their creation occurs long before a
consumer ever gets their hands on one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple’s total 2021 emissions: 22.6 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide</li>
<li>75% was the manufacture of new devices (Gupta et al. 2020)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="false-solutions">False Solutions</h2>
<p>I do not think the solution to the problems above is to simply stop
using "hi-tech" or to only use "natural" means of making sound. Valuing
only "low-tech" music creates a mirror problem to the one LeGuin points
out. Natural vs. Artificial is itself a false dichotomy with a
problematic history.</p>
<p>I also do not think that a solution lies in increasing efficiency in
manufacturing, consumption, or recycling of ICT. - Jevon’s Paradox -
Increasing efficiency will be accompanied by an increase in consumption
that wipes out the gains made through efficiency. Focusing solely on
energy and emissions also ignores a whole host of other, related
problems - notably exploitative labor relationships between the Global
North and the Global South.</p>
<p>Technical solutions rarely work in absence of culture. Anthropologist
David Graeber argued that culture is created by acts of "creative
refusal". The word "creative" is important here. In order to survive the
compound climate and ecological crises, we will need to go beyond
wholesale rejection/acceptance of the status quo.</p>
<p>We need a more general way of understanding the tangle we are in with
our technology. In Generative Engineering and Generative Justice, Ron
Eglash proposes that ...</p>
<h2 id="research-question">Research Question</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"I don't know how to build and power a refrigerator, or program a
computer, but I don't know how to make a fishhook or a pair of shoes,
either. I could learn. We all can learn. That's the neat thing about
technologies. They're what we can learn to do."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the spirit in which I want to begin my investigation of music
technology. If technology are the things we can learn to build, can we
learn to build the tools for making electronic music in a way that is
compatible with our mutual survival? Is it possible to re-claim to tools
of the "hi-tech" world and re-formulate them so they can be used
responsibly?</p>
<p>How does one create music technology in a way that is sustainable and
just? To what extent is it possible to utilize computation for creative
expression while ensuring un-alienated circulation of value through both
a community and an environment? (Eglash 2018) To what extent can one
effectively address these topics in design (by making things) and
through design (by provoking critical reactions in users and designers)?
(Mankoff 2007, Dorigatti 2022)</p>
<h2 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from
a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch
never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start
over, beginning with a working simple system. " - John Gall, General
Systematics</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Designing in, with, and for a community that already circulates
un-alienated value will reveal paths to a sustainable and just music
technology.</p>
<h3 id="scrap">scrap:</h3>
<p>The things we choose learn how to do and the things we choose build
are just that - choices. It stands to reason then that we can choose to
learn and build different things and in different ways. Technology is
often presented as inevitable - as if its invention and use were not the
result of human intervention or at least almost entirely out of human
control. This argument usually takes the form of "Well, someone else
would have done it eventually" and "once its in the world you can't go
back." Indeed "going back" is a dubious idea at best. Why would we
choose to live in a world</p>
