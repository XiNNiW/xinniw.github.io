<h1 id="immersive-media">Immersive Media</h1>
<p>Immersive Media is a class I took in the Fall of 2022 taught by Anıl
Çamcı at University of Michigan. It focused on theory and practice of
creating immersive media experiences. The projects in the course had us
create basic Video Games, VR games, as well as sonic environments and VR
based musical instruments.</p>

History Of Virtual Reality and Immersive Media</h1>
<h2 id="definition-of-terms">Definition of terms</h2>
<p><em>Virtuality</em> - an ersatz or simulated experience of reality
<em>Immersivity</em> - the experience of being submerged, surrounded. A
computational system that surrounds you.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><em>Cave Painting</em> (created <sub>45</sub>,000 years ago) - The
cave paintings of Sulawesi Island are arguably the first immersive media
experience. These caves likely served as a site of ritual and
storytelling with the media on the cave walls illuminated and used to
immerse the listener in the ritual/story.</p>
<p><em>Plato's Allegory of the Cave</em> (380 BCE) - Argued that what we
experience as reality is limited by what we get to observe. Questions
where reality begins and ends.</p>
<p>"How do I know that I am not now Dreaming? How can we tell this is
reality?" - Rene Descartes</p>
<p>A negation of abstraction - our experiences of reality are grounded
in out experiences of life.</p>
<p><em>L'arrivee</em> (1896 CE) - First film. Depicted a train rolling
toward the audience. Caused a panic on first viewing. People had never
seen any thing like this before. Their fear indicates they confused the
media with reality. They had no context for the media as it was new.</p>
<p><em>Properties of new media</em> - When people experience completely
new media they are sometimes unable to sense the distortions that
distinguish this media from reality. (ex. Edison's A/B tests in Carnegie
hall. )</p>
<p><em>View Master</em> (1939 CE) - A mechanism for taking and viewing
stereographic photographs. These photographs produce a sense of depth
when viewed through the binocular device.</p>
<p><em>Morton Helig Sensorama</em> (1957 - 1962) - Patten that
forshadowed modern VR. Included smell!</p>
<p>Morton Helig Head-mounted Display (1960) - Eerily similar to modern
head-mounted VR units.</p>
<p><em>Phillo Headsite</em> (1961)</p>
<p><em>Ivan Sutherland's Sword of Dameclese</em> (1968)</p>
<p><em>Myron Krueger's Videoplace</em> (1970s)</p>
<p><em>Artificial Reality</em> (1980s)</p>
<p><em>Tron</em> (1982)</p>
<p><em>Atari VR lab</em> (1982)</p>
<p><em>Neuromancer</em> (1984)</p>
<p><em>NASA Ames HMD</em> (mid 1980s)</p>
<p><em>VPL datasuit</em> (mid 1980s)... Data glove... AME Haskell... VPL
sought to create a collaborative VR experience where VR is designed from
inside VR by multiple people - a kind of shared lucid dream.</p>
<p><em>Computer world prediction about VR</em> (1992)</p>
<p><em>UIC Cave</em> (1992)</p>
<p><em>USCB allosphere</em> (2007)</p>
<p><em>Microsoft Kinnect</em> (2010- 2017) - RIP - the sad story of the
Kinnect illustrated that the corporate vision of tech is not always
where it wants to go. Enterprise use of technology is often very
different than the uses of everyday people.</p>
<p><em>UIC Cabe 2</em> (2012)</p>
<h1 id="vr-today-2022">VR Today (2022)</h1>
<p>Oculus Rift Samsung Gear Playstation VR Microsoft Hololens</p>
<h2 id="inside-outoutside-in-tracking">Inside out/Outside in
tracking</h2>
<p>In inside out tracking, the VR apparatus worn by the user senses the
planar surfaces surrounding the user and senses the motion of the
controllers through space.</p>
<p>In outside in tracking, external sensors track the vr apparatus,
user, and space.</p>
<p>The tracking information is used to simulate movement in the virtual
space.</p>
