<h1 id="sustainable-computing">Sustainable Computing</h1>
<p>Given how the supply chain for computers is creating massive
ecological harm, is there any way to create a more sustainable way of
computing.</p>
<p>The most sustainable computer is the one you already own. Therefore,
sustainable computing must include software specifically designed to be
performant on a wide variety of older hardware.</p>
<h3 id="portability">portability</h3>
<p>Software written against particular hardware is difficult to make
portable. The abstraction offered by a virtual machine can insulate
software logic from the specifics of a given piece of computer hardware.
The most ecologically sound computer hardware will be scavenged or
upcycled making the number of devices that need unique support is
potentially very large. Therefore, this virtual machine must remain
small enough to be easy to implement by a single person within a few
weeks of effort. This need for simplicity is in conflict with the
features that would be most useful for such a machine. Given hardware
variability, system interaction should degrade gracefully when hardware
features are not present. End-user facing software should take into
account a large number of alternate input and interaction methods.</p>
<p>Software may also need to consider the possibility that the hardware
may prefer 8, 16, 32, or 64 bit numbers. Systems like
<em>hundredrabbit's</em> <em>UXN</em> circumvent this problem by only
including 8bit numbers. This limitation makes it incredibly difficult to
compute real-time audio, however. I think <a
href="fantasy%20virtual%20music%20machine.html">a different balance
between these trade-offs</a> would need to be struck to create a
sustainable computer music environment.</p>
<p>The system I am imagining may need to present numerical types and
sizes in a way that allows the use of larger types, if available. It
should also provide the capacity to fail over gracefully to smaller
types. Small number sizes should be preferred where practical. Numerical
types may need to be templated and alternate code written for each
size.</p>
<h4 id="dependency">dependency</h4>
<p>Software dependencies should be carefully vetted for resource use,
hardware assumptions, and platform restrictions.</p>
<h3 id="resource-utilization">resource utilization</h3>
<p>Resource utilization should be as minimal as possible. Software
should potentially be written to adapt to different resource profiles,
providing different feature implementations for each level.</p>
<h3 id="aesthetics">aesthetics</h3>
<p>Life-like replication of sensory experiences using computers have
been enabled by increasing filesizes, bitdepths, and samplerates.
Advertising resource use of media became a kind of shorthand to signify
its quality. This isn't to say that it is pointless to operate on 32bit
float, 96k sampled audio, for example. There are manipulations that you
can make using these specs that you cannot make without degrading the
quality of the output in a noticeable way. However, the aesthetic
quality of the degradation is sometimes interesting in of itself. Who is
to say which version is better? Does a sustainable version of computing
require different aesthetics for media - one that appreciates the sound
of these distortions? Its not as if these distortions are universally
despised, or even that they are unpleasant. There are event plugins that
spend extra CPU resources to emulate them on systems where they will not
be produced naturally.</p>
<p>In an essay on <a href="Permacomputing.html">Permacomputing</a>,
viznut speculates about this aesthetic: "For extreme realism,
perfection, detail and sharpness, people would prefer to look at
nature."</p>
