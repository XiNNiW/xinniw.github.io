<h3 id="afrorack">Afrorack</h3>
<p>Brian Bamanya is a Ugandan artist, designer, and technologist who
made his own modular synthesizer out of mostly scavenged parts. In a
tongue in cheek reference to the eurorack standard he named his
synthesizer system <em>Afrorack</em>. While sustainability was not his
initial interest in the system design, many of the same design
constraints he faced would apply to a more sustainable way of making
electronic musical instruments. - modularity - second-hard scavenged
parts</p>
<p>Some questions I have are that his work is primarily a DIY adventure.
One would have to acquire advanced engineering skills in order to follow
his path. However, he himself did not have all of these skills at the
beginning of his journey. Rather, he acquired them through making. I
question the persistent "scalability" question as I think it has a bunch
of assumptions from startup culture and the interests of venture capital
baked in. However, I do think it is valid to wonder how a musician
interested in electronic music would acquire their instrument when they
do not know how how and/or are uninterested in learning electrical
engineering in order to make work. The DIY aesthetic itself is also a
potential barrier in some contexts. What if a musician wants an
instrument that looks polished and professionally made. Are there
solutions that add these constraints to the more important constraints
of the stress of the project on the ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behind the Afrorack is a desire to break with American and European
and to reconnect with his African roots. “Our heritage does not come
from Detroit, Chicago or Berlin – but from our own musical traditions. I
am convinced that the next electronic music revolution will take place
in Africa,” he said with confidence back in 2019.&gt; Indeed, the
current synthesizers sold on the market are mostly American or German.
Besides their exorbitant price and their scarcity in Uganda, Bamyana
rejects industrial tools. “The charm of DIY lies in its power of
emancipation: you are able to build yourself an instrument so you are
able to create music. I find it very anti-consumerist and I like that a
lot“. source: <a

<h3 id="r">100r</h3>
<p>hundred rabbits (100r) are a design team who live aboard a small
sailboat. Their interests include permacomputing and software
preservation. UXN is a computer language they wrote for designing
software that would last a really long time and would be able to be run
on old, outmoded computer hardware. It has been an incredibly successful
project. I've seen evidence of artistic software for UXN running on old
PDA's, computers from the early 90s, gameboys, and modern computers.</p>
<p>UXN is able to do this because it targets a small virtual machine
with limited specs. (For example: all numbers are 8bit). The language is
based on Forth. As Forth is a stack machine and only minimally
abstracted from the underlying machine, this makes it easy to implement
and re-implement. sssssssssssssddwsdddwwassds While I agree with their
observation that much of the "progress" of computer tech in the last
decades has just been bigger numbers, bigger files, and more wasted
processor cycles, I think that the specs of UXN are a bit too limited to
explore some really exciting DSP and artistic applications of
technology. What does portable, preservable digital synthesis look
like?</p>
<h3 id="modular-synthesis">Modular synthesis</h3>
<p>Modular synthesizers are an interesting conundrum when viewed through
the lens of sustainable tech. On the one hand they seem designed in a
more sustainable fashion. As valuable hardware synthesizers and music
tools they are unlikely to be thrown away. As they are self-contained
and interoperable, they are somewhat immune to forced obsolescence.
Their open standards (such as eurorack) are modular. This makes the
instrument easier to repair and customize over time - extending its life
and novelty.</p>
<p>However, they are prohibitably expensive - the domain of collectors
and hardware aficionados. It could take thousands of dollars to acquire
enough equipment to replicate the same functionality that one could find
with free VST plugins and any modern DAW. They are often collected by
nerdy men who have disposable income and the culture surrounding them
has a problematic history as a boy's club. ("muffwiggler" ect...) They
are marketed based on novelty and those who use them seem to always be
acquiring more equipment. This cuts against the sustainable potential of
the technology.</p>
<p>Its unknown how repairable these instruments will ultimately be. One
place to look for answers might be how historic modular synthesizers are
maintained after their parts go out of production.</p>
