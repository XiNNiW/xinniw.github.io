<p><em>How to Write One Song</em> is a book by Jeff Tweedy on the
practice of songwriting. He writes about his philosophy and approach to
writing. For Tweedy writing songs is a constant practice. More than a
craft, it is a part of him taking care of himself. He advocates for a
craft approach with and emphasis on daily practice over inspiration. He
shares a number of exercises that he has found useful to get himself
having fun with language:</p>
<ul>
<li>the word ladder</li>
<li>writing to someone else's rhythm</li>
<li>writing to someone else's chord progression</li>
<li>transcription of conversation into meter</li>
</ul>
