<h1 id="functional-programming">Functional Programming</h1>
<p>:cc0: Functional Programming is a paradigm for software design. It
favors implementing functionality by composition of pure function and
demands that side effects be strictly separated from <a

<p>This pure code has <a

it is possible to reason about its behavior mathematically.</p>

<p>The following are generally common to functional design. However, not
all languages have built in support for these concepts. Trying to keep
code pure can be puzzling as a computer program is inherently useless
until it produces some tangible side effect. The following language
features generally make this puzzle easier to solve.</p>
