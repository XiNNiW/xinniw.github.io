<h1 id="the-dispossessed">The Dispossessed</h1>
<p><em>The Dispossessed</em> is a novel by Ursula K. Leguin. It tells
the story of a scientist named Shevik and his search - for a grand
unified theory of physics and for freedom for himself and his people.
Shevik grows up on Annares - the large moon of a world named Urras.
Annares was once a mining colony. 300 years before Shevik's birth there
is a global general strike on the world of Urras. The anarchists make a
deal with the world governments to leave Urras and to live apart from
the rest of the people on the moon of Annares. In the following 300
years no-one is allowed to travel to either world. Annares trades
precious minerals with the governments of Urras. However, no-one is
allowed beyond the low wall that surrounds the landing pads. The novel
deals with themes of freedom and responsibility.</p>
<p>The story is told in two timelines. In one, an adult Shevik leaves
Annares for Urras - to finish his work in physics, encourage social
reform on Annares, and to try to unify the peoples of the two worlds. In
the other timeline, we follow Shevik's early life from childhood to the
moment he decides to leave for Urras.</p>
<p>The novel bears the subtitle "an ambiguous utopia" and tries to
engage realistically with the problems encountered by the people of both
worlds. While Leguin clearly has great affection for anarchism, she
refuses to glamorize the society of Annares or Urras. Instead, she
conveys the problems and frailties of both societies with an
anthropological eye. When Shevik is in Urras you see a society much like
that of the UK or the US through the eyes of an outsider. When the story
switches to Shevik's earlier timeline you see both the strength and
weakness of Annares as Shevik ultimately tries to reform Annaran society
to preserve its anarchy/freedom.</p>
<p>His journey to reform Annares explores a concept of freedom that is
attained only through mutuality and solidarity. While Annaran society
does not have laws, it does have powerful social expectations. The power
of these social forces threatens to consolidate into an authoritarian
bureaucracy. Shevik seeks to balance individual initiative with
responsibility to the collective. Through use of metaphorical and
physical walls, Leguin implies that while Annares shuts itself off from
the outside, it has sealed itself in and created a prison. Freedom for
Annares ultimately means breaking their isolation.</p>
<p>The novel has an ambiguous ending. We are uncertain of Shevik's fate
as he returns to Annares. Will he be accepted by his people or killed by
an angry mob? Will the Annaran experiment fail and collapse into
bureaucracy or will its anarchy be renewed?</p>
<h2 id="the-wall">the wall</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Like all walls it was ambiguous, two-faced. What was inside it and
what was outside it depended upon which side of it you were on.</p>
<p>Looked at from one side, the wall enclosed a barren sixty-acre field
called the Port of Anarres. On the field there were a couple of large
gantry cranes, a rocket pad, three warehouses, a truck garage, and a
dormitory. The dormitory looked durable, grimy, and mournful; it had no
gardens, no children; plainly nobody lived there or was even meant to
stay there long. It was in fact a quarantine. The wall shut in not only
the landing field but also the ships that came down out of space, and
the men that came on the ships, and the worlds they came from, and the
rest of the universe. It enclosed the universe, leaving Anarres outside,
free.</p>
<p>Looked at from the other side, the wall enclosed Anarres: the whole
planet was inside it, a great prison camp, cut off from other worlds and
other men, in quarantine."</p>

<h2 id="prisons">prisons</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>They had picked up the idea of “prisons” from episodes in the Life of
Odo, which all of them who had elected to work on History were reading.
There were many obscurities in the book, and Wide Plains had nobody who
knew enough history to explain them; but by the time they got to Odo's
years in the Fort in Drio, the concept “prison” had become
self-explanatory. And when a circuit history teacher came through the
town he expounded the subject, with the reluctance of a decent adult
forced to explain an obscenity to children. Yes, he said, a prison was:
a place where a State put people who disobeyed its Laws. But why didnt
they just leave the place? They couldn't leave, the doors were locked.
Locked? Like the doors on a moving truck, so you don't fall out, stupid!
But what did they do inside one room all the time? Nothing. There was
nothing to do. You've seen pictures of Odo in the prison cell in Drio,
haven't you? Image of defiant patience, bowed grey head, clenched hands,
motionless in encroaching shadows. Sometimes prisoners were sentenced to
work. Sentenced? Well, that means a judge, a person given power by the
Law, ordered them to do some kind of physical labor. Ordered them? What
if they didn't want to do it? Well. they were forced to do it; if they
didnt work, they were beaten. A thrill of tension went through the
children listening, eleven- and twelve-year-olds, none of whom had ever
been struck, or seen any person struck, except in immediate personal
anger.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I'm sorry. Dr. Shevek — a precaution — contagion — keeping the
others out — ”</p>
<p>“To lock out, to lock in, the same act,” Shevek said looking down at
the doctor with light, remote eyes.</p>

<p>“The clothes are burned?”</p>
<p>“Oh, those are cheap pajamas, service issue — wear

<p>“It costs less,” Shevek repeated meditatively. He said them words the
way a paleontologist looks at a fossil, the fossil that dates a whole
stratum.</p>

<h2 id="natural-authority">natural authority</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The senior physicist at the Institute was named Mitis. She was not at
present directing the physics curriculum, as all administrative jobs
rotated annually among the twenty permanent postings, but she had been
at the place thirty years, and had the best mind among them. There was
always a kind of psychological clear space around Mitis, like the lack
of crowds around the peak of a mountain. The absence of all enhancements
and enforcements of authority left the real thing plain. There are
people of inherent authority; some emperors actually have new
clothes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was appalled by the examination system, when it was explained to
him; he could not imagine a greater deterrent to the natural wish to
leam than this pattern of cramming in information and disgorging it at
demand. At first he refused to give any tests or grades, but this upset
the University administrators so badly that, not wishing to be
discourteous to his hosts, he gave in. He asked his students to write a
paper on any problem in physics that interested them, and told them that
he would give them all the highest mark, so that the bureaucrats would
have something to write on their forms and lists. To his surprise a good
many students came to him to complain. They wanted him to set the
problems, to ask the right questions; they did not want to think about
questions, but to write down the answers they had learned. And some of
them objected strongly to his giving everyone the same mark. How could
the diligent students be distinguished from the dull ones? What was the
good in working hard? If no competitive distinctions were to be made,
one might as well do nothing.</p>
<p>“Well, of course,” Shevek said, troubled. “If you do not want to do
the work, you should not do it.”</p>
<p>They went away unappeased, but polite. They were pleasant boys, with
frank and civil manners. Shevek's readings in Urrasti history led him to
decide that they were, in fact, though the word was seldom used these
days, aristocrats. In feudal times the aristocracy had sent their sons
to university, conferring superiority on the institution. Nowadays it
was the other way rounds the university conferred superiority on the
man. They told Shevek with pride that the competition for scholarships
to leu Eun was stiffer every year, proving the essential democracy of
the institution. He said, “You put another lock on the door and call it
democracy.” He liked his polite, intelligent students, but he felt no
great warmth towards any of them. They were planning careers as academic
or industrial scientists, and what they learned from him was to them a
means to that end, success in their careers. They either had, or denied
the importance of, anything else he might have offered them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He wondered why the government did not stop him from speaking.
Chifoilisk must have exaggerated, for his own purposes, the extent of
the control and censorship they could exert. He talked pure anarchism,
and they did not stop him. But did they need to stop him? It seemed that
he talked to the same people every time: well dressed, well fed, well
mannered, smiling. Were they the only kind of people on Urras? “It is
pain that brings men together,” Shevek said standing up before them, and
they nodded and said, “How true.”</p>
<p>He began to hate them and, realizing that, abruptly ceased accepting
their invitations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-frailty-of-freedom">the frailty of freedom</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Shevek turned around to face him. “But you can't seriously talk of a
government, here!”</p>
<p>“Tomar's Definitions:
<code>Government: The legal use of power to maintain and extend power.' Replace</code>legal'
with `customary,' and you've got Sabul, and the Syndicate of
Instruction, and the PDC.”</p>
<p>“The PDC!”</p>
<p>“The PDC is, by now, basically an archistic bureaucracy.”</p>
<p>After a moment Shevek laughed, not quite naturally, and said, “Well,
come on, Dap, this is amusing, but it's a bit diseased, isn't it?”</p>
<p>“Shev, did you ever think that what the analogic mode calls
`disease,' social disaffection, discontent, alienation, that this might
analogically also be called pain — what you meant when you talked about
pain, suffering? And that, like pain, it serves a function in the
organism?”</p>
<p>“No!” Shevek said, violently. “I was talking in personal, in
spiritual terms.”</p>
<p>“But you spoke of physical suffering, of a man dying of bums. And I
speak of spiritual suffering! Of people seeing their talent, their work,
their lives wasted. Of good minds submitting to stupid ones. Of strength
and courage strangled by envy, greed for power, fear of change. Change
is freedom, change is life — is anything more basic to Odonian thought
than that? But nothing changes any more! Our society is sick. You know
it. You're suffering its sickness. Its suicidal sickness!”</p>
<p>“That's enough. Dap. Drop it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“It's not the individuals posted to PDC, Shev. Most of them are like
us. All too much like us. Well-meaning, naive. And it's not just PDC.
It's anywhere on Anarrea. Learning centers, institutes, mines, mills,
fisheries, canneries, agricultural development and research stations,
factories, one-product communities — anywhere that function demands
expertise and a stable institution. But that stability gives scope to
the authoritarian impulse. In the early years of the Settlement we were
aware of that, on the lookout for it. People discriminated very
carefully then between administering things and governing people. They
did it so well that we forgot that the will to dominance is as central
in human beings as the impulse to mutual aid is, and has to be trained
in each individual, in each new generation. Nobody's born an Odonian any
more than he's born civilized! But we've forgotten that. We don't
educate for freedom. Education, the most important activity of the
social organism, has become rigid, moralistic, authoritarian. Kids leam
to parrot Odo's words as if they were laws — the ultimate
blasphemy!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“Of course not. The only security we have is our neighbors' approval.
An archist can break a law and hope to get away unpunished, but you
can't 'break' a custom; it's the framework of your life with other
people. We're only just beginning to feel what it's like to be
revolutionaries, as Shev put it in the meeting today. And it isn't
comfortable.”</p>

<h2 id="the-plight-of-salas">the plight of salas</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“But the Music syndics don't like my compositions. And nobody much
else does, yet I can't be a syndicate all by myself, can I?”</p>
<p>Salas was a bony little man, already bald on the upper face and
cranium; he wore what was left of his hair short, in a silky beige
fringe around the back of his neck and chin. His smile was sweet,
wrinkling his expressive face. “You see, I don't write the way I was
trained to write at the conservatory. I write dysfunctional music.” He
smiled more sweetly than ever. “They want chorales. I hate chorales.
They want wide-harmony pieces like Sessur wrote. I hate Sessur's music.
I'm writing a piece of chamber music. Thought I might call it The
Simultaneity Principle. Five instruments each playing an independent
cyclic theme; no melodic causality; the forward process entirely in the
relationship of the parts. It makes a lovely harmony. But they don't
hear it. They won't hear it. They can't.”</p>
<p>Shevek brooded a while. “If you called it The Joys of Solidarity,” he
said, “would they hear it?”</p>
<p>“By damni” said Bedap, who was listening in. “That's the first
cynical thing you ever said in your life, Shev. Welcome to the work
crew!”</p>
<p>Salag laughed. `They'd give it a hearing, but they'd turn it down for
taping or regional performance. It's not in the Organic Style.”</p>
<p>“No wonder I never heard any professional music while I lived in
Northsetting. But how can they justify this kind of censorship? You
write music! Music is a cooperative art, organic by definition, social.
It may be the noblest form of social behavior we're capable of. It's
certainly one of the noblest jobs an individual can undertake. And by
its nature, by the nature of any art, it's a sharing. The artist shares,
it's the essence of his act. No matter what your syndics say, how can
Divlab justify not giving you a posting in your own field?”</p>
<p>“They don't want to share it,” Salas said gleefully. “It scares
`em.”</p>
<p>Bedap spoke more gravely; “They can Justify it because music isn't
useful. Canal digging is important, you know; music's mere decoration.
The circle has come right back around to the most vile kind of
profiteering utilitarianism. The complexity, the vitality, the freedom
of invention and initiative that was the center of the Odonian ideal,
we've thrown it all away. We've gone right back to barbarism. If it's
new, run away from it; if you cant eat it, throw it away!”</p>

<h2 id="suffering">suffering</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You couldnt touch him to comfort him, the skin and flesh would come
away at your touch, and he'd scream. You couldn't do anything for him.
There was no aid to give. Maybe he knew we were there, I don't know. It
didn't do him any good. You couldn't do anything for him. Then I saw
...you see ...I saw that you can't do anything for anybody. We can't
save each other. Or ourselves.”</p>
<p>“What have you left, then? Isolation and despair! You're denying
brotherhood, Shevek!” the tall girl cried.</p>
<p>“No — no, I'm not. I'm trying to say what I think brotherhood really
is. It begins — it begins in shared pain.”</p>
<p>“Then where does it end?”</p>
<p>“I dont know. I don't know yet.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is our suffering that brings us together. It is not love. Love
does not obey the mind, and turns to hate when forced. The bond that
binds us is beyond choice. We are brothers. We are brothers in what we
share. In pain, which each of us must suffer alone, in hunger, in
poverty, in hope, we know our brotherhood. We know it, because we have
had to learn it. We know that there is no help for us but from one
another, that no hand will save us if we do not reach out our hand. And
the hand that you reach out is empty, as mine is. You have nothing. You
possess nothing. You own nothing. You are free. All you have is what you
are, and what you give.</p>
