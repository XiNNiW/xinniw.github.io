<h1 id="linear-predictive-coding-lpc">Linear Predictive Coding
(LPC)</h1>
<p>Linear predictive coding is a set of analysis and re-synthesis
techniques. It is often used for data compression of speech but also has
application for cross-synthesis, pitch corrections, and other more
experimental techniques. It works by modeling a source signal as a set
of all-pole bandpass filters excited by either a noise source or a
pulse-wave. The coefficients of these filters are estimated using linear
regression and animated over time to create the illusion of speech. As a
data compression technique it can achieve up to a 17:1 reduction in data
for a speech signal.</p>
<p>It excels at modelling speech but can also be highly successful in
modelling other monophonic sounds that include pitched and unpitched
moments.</p>
<p>When modelling speech, the noise source is used to excite the filters
during consonants and the pulse wave is used to excite the filters
during vowels.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>A given input signal <span class="math inline">\(x(n)\)</span> is
modelled as a bank of bandpass filters (<span
class="math inline">\(h(n)\)</span>) excited by a source signal (<span
class="math inline">\(e(n)\)</span>).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
x(n) = h(n)*e(n)
\]</span> If the timestep being modelled is a pitched sound <span
class="math inline">\(e(n)\)</span> will be modelled as a pulse train.
If the timestep is unpitched <span class="math inline">\(e(n)\)</span>
will be white noise. In either case, <span
class="math inline">\(e(n)\)</span> is spectrally flat and all harmonic
information is modelled in the filter <span
class="math inline">\(h(n)\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[
X(z) = H(z)E(z)$
     = \frac{1}{1 - \sum{k=1}^p a_{k}z^-k}E(z)
= \sum{k=0}^p a_{k}z^-k X(z) + E(z)
...z transform...
x(n) = \sum{k=1}^p a_{k}x(n-k) + e(n)
\]</span></p>
<p>In order to create the model above we need values for our filter and
we need to know if we should use noise or a pitched sound for our
source. If we want a pitched sound we also need to know what pitch we
should use.</p>
<h3 id="estimating-filter-coefficients">Estimating filter
coefficients</h3>
<p>If we can find the coeficcients <span class="math display">\[a_{k},
k=1...p\]</span> for a given timestep, we can model the signal for that
timestep.</p>
<p>Note: in order to do this our signal needs to be longer than the
<span class="math display">\[p\]</span> timesteps neccesary for our
filter memory.</p>
<p>Given <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> samples we can write
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> equations and solve them. $$ a =
\begin{bmatrix} a_{1} \ ... \ a_{p} \end{bmatrix} x_{i} =
[x(n-1+i)...x(n-p+i)]</p>
<p>x(n) = x_{0} \cdot a + e(n) x(n+1) = x_{1} \cdot a + e(n) ... x(n+N)
= x_{N} \cdot a + e(n+N) $$</p>
<p>Each equation contains our <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
coefficients based on the samples from our signal <span
class="math inline">\(x(n)\)</span>. This system is overdetermined as
there are more equations than variables to solve. Therefor, we
approximate a solution using the method of least squares.</p>
<p>We can rewrite our equations as: <span class="math display">\[
e = b - A \cdot a
  = b - \hat{b}
\]</span> where: <span class="math display">\[
b = \begin{bmatrix} \\ x(n) \\ ... \\ x(n-N) \end{bmatrix}
e = \begin{bmatrix} e(n) \\ ... \\ e(n-N) \eng{bmatrix}
A = \begin{bmatrix} x_{0} \\ ... \\ x_{N} \end{bmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>Notice that <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is our original
signal <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{b}\)</span> is our estimated signal, and our
noise/pulse input <span class="math inline">\(e(n)\)</span> is now the
error of our estimation.</p>
<p>In the method of least squares, we try to minimize that value of
<span class="math inline">\(||e(n)||^2\)</span>. As the system is
overdetermined, there is no exact solution. Another way of saying this
is that our signal vector <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is not
in the column space defined by <span class="math inline">\(A \cdod
a\)</span>. When we say minimize <span
class="math inline">\(||e(n)||^2\)</span> we want to find the line that
IS in our column space that is as close as possible to <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. The vector in our column space that is
closest is defined as the projection of <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> onto <span class="math inline">\(A
\cdot a\)</span>. (Kahn academy video for solving this system:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC7l96tW8V8)</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
a = (A^T A)^-1 A^T b
\]</span> With this we have found the resonances.</p>
<h3 id="estimating-the-residual-en">Estimating the residual, e(n)</h3>
<p>We need to know the following: - the power of the signal x(n) - the
pitch of x(n) ... this will require pitch detection</p>
<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>We break the signal up into windows <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> samples long, apply and overlap add
window function, and use the process above to solve the values of <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span>.</p>
<p>something something Yule-Walker equations and FFT for faster
implementation... they provide a way to get <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and the power/variance from the
auto-correlation of the signal... <span class="math display">\[
R \vec{a} = -\vec{r}
a = -R^-1 \vec{r}
\]</span></p>
