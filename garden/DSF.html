Formula)</h1>
<p>:cc0:</p>
<p>A DSF is an approximation of an ideal waveform (such as SAW or
SQUARE) that uses trig identities to approximate the wave up to a given
number of harmonics.</p>
<p>All periodic sound can be represented a <a
href="Fourier%20series">Fourier series</a> of individual sine and cosine
waves. This infinite series can be truncated to produce a wave with a
given number of harmonics. (see: <a
href="Bandlimited%20Oscillator">Bandlimited Oscillator</a>) This
truncated sum may have a "closed form" solution when trig identities can
be used to reduce the sum to a single term. This makes it more efficient
to implement than <a href="Additive%20Synthesis.html">Additive
Synthesis</a>.</p>
<p>Like the basic <a href="BLIT">BLIT</a> algorithm, DSF has limitations
when it comes to smoothly changing/glissing frequencies the number of
harmonics in a DSF formula is an integer value. When trying to render a
<a href="glissando.html">glissando</a> with a DSF the harmonics entering
and leaving the sound can be heard as abrupt steps.</p>
<h1 id="example">example</h1>
<p>The following is a summary of an example presented in <em>Computer
Music</em> by Dodge and Jerse:</p>
<p>A band-limited pulse wave with <code>N</code> harmonics can be
constructed with the formula:</p>
<p>$ y(t) = \frac {A} {N} \sum_{k=1}<sup>N</sup> cos(2 \pi kf_ot) $</p>
<p>This sum can be reduced to the following "closed form" DSF:</p>
<p>$ y(t) = \frac {A} {2N} [\frac {sin((2N+1) \pi f_ot)} {sin(\pi f_o
t)} -1]$</p>
<p>An implementation using the bottom form will need to account for the
case where the denominator goes to zero. For this case the formula above
can be re-written with cosines:</p>
<p>$ y(t) = \frac {A} {2N} [\frac {(2N+1) cos((2N+1) \pi f_ot)} {cos(\pi
f_o t)} - 1] $</p>
