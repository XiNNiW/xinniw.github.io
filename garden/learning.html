<h1 id="learning">Learning</h1>
<p>Notes on the process of learning, how to learn, things learned about
learning.</p>
<h4 id="its-easier-with-someone-else">Its easier with someone else</h4>
<p>I learn best when in conversation with someone else. <a
href="Pairing.html">Pairing</a> is brilliant for this. You both work
together to learn enough to solve your current problem. You teach each
other, gaining both the benefits of learning and teaching.</p>
<h4 id="teach">Teach</h4>
<p>If you can't explain it to someone else in a way that is simple and
understandable you don't really know it. To teach someone you have to
understand how they are seeing and create a path from where they are to
the idea. If you can't connect the idea to something that they already
know, you don't know where the idea is.</p>
<h4 id="write">Write</h4>
<p>Writing your thoughts down forces them to solidify. Making your
writing better improves the clarity of your ideas. Our memories are also
quite short. Writing your thoughts down lets you work around the
shortness of memory and remember ideas long enough to make connections
between them.</p>
<h4 id="non-linear-note-taking">Non-linear note-taking</h4>
<p>Finding connections between ideas is a fundamental part of what it
means to learn something. <a
href="Non-linear%20note-taking.html">Non-linear note-taking</a> is a way
to allow those connections to grow over time and to traverse your
writing by those connections as opposed to a more arbitrary index (such
as date written).</p>
