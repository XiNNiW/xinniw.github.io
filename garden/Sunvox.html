<h1 id="sunvox">Sunvox</h1>
<p>Sunvox is a DAW software created by Alexander Zolotov that uses a
combination of <a href="tracker.html">tracker</a> and timeline metaphors
for organizing musical events in time. It uses a modular metaphor for
audio where the user draws a graph of connections between sound
generators, effects, and outputs. It is unusually efficient and
portable. Versions of sunvox can run on anything from palm pilots to
laptop computers. Sunvox exposes a C api that can be used to embed
sunvox composed music into games. These compositions can take advantage
of some generative/random elements embedded in the sunvox tracker.</p>
<p>As sunvox is closed source it is hard to speculate on the specific
implementation decisions that make it so portable and efficient. However
we can infer some information from UX decisions and through inspection
of sunvox generated files.</p>
<h3 id="graceful-degradation">Graceful degradation</h3>
<p>Sunvox provides a feature for many of its sound modules to be run in
Low Quality [LQ] or High Quality [HQ] modes. It also allows unusually
low fidelity settings in its settings menu. Special builds of the
software providing only low quality modules can target low power
devices. Projects created on low power devices can be shared with
high-powered devices through shared implementation of low quality
modules and a shared file format. If a project is started in
high-quality mode and moved to a low power device, it will gracefully
degrade to a level of quality that is more practical for the smaller
device.</p>
<h3 id="custom-graphics-using-old-game-engines">Custom graphics using
old game engines</h3>
<p>When you inspect sunvox song and preference files it becomes clear
that Zolotov is using the game engine SDL to implement the laptop and
mobile versions of sunvox. SDL is a lightweight game engine that is
famous for being used by Valve for its half-life games in the early
2000's. It has been continuously maintained and still provides a fairly
unpessimized cross-platform access to graphics and audio layers of its
host operating system.</p>
<h3 id="zolotov-as-artisan---sunvox-as-community">Zolotov as Artisan -
Sunvox as Community</h3>
<p>Zolotov is the sole maintainer of sunvox. Though the software is
closed source, Zolotov provides it for free or (in the case of mobile
devices) for nearly free. (The cost of the mobile versions is likely due
to the fees extracted by Apple and Google respectively). Zolotov
maintains crowdfunded patronage through his website and attacts a
vibrant community of users who pitch in to help the project advance.
This assistance is sometimes financial and sometimes in the form of
donated music, and presets - many of which are packaged with the
distribution of the software as example songs. Zolotov maintains a
regular song contest where he compiles compositions from this community
and publishes them alongside generated visualizations on Youtube.
Winners are typically included in new releases of Sunvox. Zolotov also
maintains forums that provide a space for community members to virtually
gather. These forums contain discussions of music, swapping of
techniques and patches, as well as ongoing personal relationships and
friendships. The forums also provide an avenue for sunvox's users to
lobby for features that they would like to see in future versions of the
software. Many of these requests receive personal attention by
Zolotov.</p>
