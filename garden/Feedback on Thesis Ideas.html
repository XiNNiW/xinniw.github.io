<h1 id="feedback-on-thesis-ideas">Feedback on thesis ideas</h1>
<p>I showed my <a href="Potential%20Thesis%20Ideas.html">Potential
Thesis Ideas</a> to Michael and Anıl and they gave me feedback:</p>
<h2 id="michael">Michael</h2>
<p>How can you move beyond an artifact based approach? How will this be
a research project? What is your research question? What methodology
will you use to answer your question?</p>
<p>Suggestions: Look at critical design (Bardzell) Look at speculative
making (Christina Anderson) Start at the ideas and work back to the
questions... then work your way to new ideas Are there latent themes in
the ideas/questions Annotate with sources your ideas</p>
<p>Favorites: Gamelon Inspired Synthesizer Ideas because it asks the
clearest question and touches on community The question of aesthetics
and sustainability</p>
<p>By the end of the semester: - Have a thesis advisor - 2 paragraphs
that concretely describe your thesis project</p>
<h2 id="anıl">Anıl</h2>
<p>Who are you building these things for? How do old computers (low
power computers) get on the internet? Is there a combination of Eglash's
work with Eurorack... artisans making things, modular design, how do you
target one of the problematic aspects and make it better? Are web based
DAWs multi-user? Where can you find videogame controllers lying around?
If you aren't making your own hardware</p>
<p>Suggestions: - look at Garnet Hertz - What do you want your showcase
to look like? - look at case studies: Daisy platform as a case study,
Monome as a case study, Eurorack as a case study - look at gibberwocky -
narrow it down to something you can do in less than a year - look across
your ideas and try different combinations</p>
<p>Additional Ideas: - prototype of a language... different input
paradigm... young people give a performance</p>
<p>Favorites: - DAW as interaction paradigm for livecoding...</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-answer-the-methodologyresearch-question">how do i
answer the methodology/research question</h3>
<p>I want to build things but its clear that building things is not
enough - some new knowledge must be produced. How is this knowledge to
be produced? I don't want to stop at critique. I really don't want to do
sustainability theatre or pretend to solve a problem/pretend to create
knowledge. I want my work to be useful to others. This sounds like
engineering new technology but I don't think that is sufficient as so
many of the issues at hand have cultural/social components.</p>
<p>On the one hand I'm impatient and this seems like its pushing me away
from building the things I am interested in building... On the other
hand these questions are encouraging me to be rigorous in defining my
project and making sure that it does real work.</p>
<p>How will I evaluate my own work?</p>
<p>I read a paper by philosopher/chemist Joachim Shummer about the
epistemology of knowing though making in chemistry and how it contrasts
with technology and physics. He argues that theoretical physics applies
a kind of armchair epistemology that is inappropriate to science. He
outlines a history of knowing though making in the sciences. He argues
that, to know something you need to analyze it and synthesize it. You
must be able to describe it and then use that description to make it out
of whole cloth. This process has to alter the ontology that you had
going in in order to create new knowledge. He lays out weaker versions
of KTM that learn by modifying or learn technique and craft by doing. By
completing any of the projects within the technical/social guidelines I
lay out proves that it can be done and provide knowledge on how to do
it. People like Joachim Schummer argue that this is technology not
science and that this kind of Knowing Through Making (KTM) is trivial
know-how.</p>
<p>What are sociological/anthropological ways of knowing? Is there a way
to frame the project so it explores David Graeber's epistemological idea
that knowledge is created through dialog.</p>
<p>What kind of knowledge am I trying to make? There is part of me that
is instictively interested in the kind of knowledge that Schummer calls
trivial. I want to prove the vitality and viability of systems that
circulate value while providing means for art. This is not a commercial
kind of knowledge but a social and cultural one.</p>
