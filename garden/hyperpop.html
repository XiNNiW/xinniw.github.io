<h1 id="hyperpop">Hyperpop</h1>
<p>:cc0: :stub: Hyperpop is a genre of music characterized by
distortion, catchy rhythms and melodies, and synthetic, heavily
processed sounds. Many of the genre's most important artist identify as
gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and many songs feature issues of
identity, love, and belonging.</p>
<p>While there are genre signifiers for hyperpop (autotune, catchy
melodies, extreme distortion, bombastic and virtuosic sound design) the
whole thing feels like it has an ethos of inclusion and permission. In
so far as it is a "genre" its a genre that give you permission to cross
features of any two genres together, autotune and pitch shift the vocal,
distort the crap out of the synthline. Hyperpop says: "Do these things
because they feel good. Do whatever you want because you love it." This
is what makes it so fun to listen to for me. It makes me question all
sorts of unexamined assumptions about what is cool, what I can get away
with musically. It feels like it was built by artists composing out of
the materials they liked and not caring if those sources were "cool";
not filtering because of what other people think. That feeling give me
permission and inspiration to try all sorts of things I might not have
otherwise tried. It also makes me re-evaluate genres and pop work that I
might have overlooked because I had bought some stigma about it not
being "cool" (ex. eurodance). Fuck that shit! Eurodance sounds amazing.
Pop melodies and structures sound amazing!</p>
<p>I think I also love hearing these bombastic poppy productions with
lyrics that are deeply interesting and that I keep coming back to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My face is the front of shop My face is the real shop front My shop
is the face I front, front I'm real when I shop my face</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Faceshopping, Sophie</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I love everything about that writing. I love the simplicity of the
language, the play achieved using a limited set of words, the rhythmic
intensity. It reminds me of my favorite things about Deerhoof lyrics and
Stereolab lyrics. These words are deceptively simple and contain a large
and complicated idea. They are also catchy as fuck.</p>
