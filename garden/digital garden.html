<p>A digital garden is a personal knowledge repository/website that
allows its user to learn in public view by writing articles about topics
that they learn. It can be explored by means of links and backlinks to
other topics. It is an example of an online experience in the paradigm
of a garden as opposed to the more ubiquitous stream paradigm that
dominates modern web experience. (see: <a
href="Garden%20v%20Stream%20dichotomy.html">Garden vs. Stream
dichotomy</a>) The user may "wander the paths" of the garden finding
unexpected connections. These connections foster learning as topics are
expanded over time.</p>
<p>A digital garden is also a kind of personal wiki, and a real life an
example of a memex.</p>
