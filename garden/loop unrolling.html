<p>:cc0:</p>
<p>Loop unrolling is an optimization that is typically made by the
compiler, although it can be manually accomplished in assembly. When an
iteration occurs in the code, and the number of times the iteration
loops is known at compile time, the loop can be unrolled. Unrolling the
loop means replacing the iteration instruction with hard-coded
instructions for each iteration one after the other. For example,
consider the following loop:</p>
<pre><code>for (size_t index=0; index&lt;3; index++){
    std::cout&lt;&lt;index;
}</code></pre>
<p>The unrolled version is:</p>
<pre><code>std::cout&lt;&lt;1;
std::cout&lt;&lt;2;
std::cout&lt;&lt;3;</code></pre>
<p>Since we know we are going to loop 3 times when we compile, we can
replace the loop with hard-coded instructions. The resulting assembly is
much faster than conditionally looping.</p>
