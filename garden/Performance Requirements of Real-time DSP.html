<h1 id="performance-requirements-of-real-time-dsp">Performance
Requirements of Real-time DSP</h1>
<p>In order to convincingly generate/manipulate audio in real time
without audible clicks or pops, the audio code must be capable of
delivering rendered samples to the output at a speed that is faster than
the sample rate. If the algorithm is unable to complete rendering a
section of audio before playback, nasty clicks and glitches will
occur.</p>
<h2 id="things-not-to-do-on-the-audio-thread">Things NOT to do on the
audio thread</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>DON'T</strong> allocate memory</li>
<li><strong>DON'T</strong> do any kind of IO</li>
<li><strong>DON'T</strong> lock the thread or interact with locks on
other threads</li>
<li><strong>DON'T</strong> throw or handle exceptions, don't use code
that is capable of throwing exceptions. (even having exceptions in your
code path adds branching)</li>
</ol>
<p>The above operations have one thing in common: they take an
indeterminate amount of time to resolve, if they resolve at all, or they
are just plain slow (eg. exceptions). Locking or interacting with other
threads that can lock can be disastrous and cause enormous performance
penalties or worse deadlock. The OS typically does not give the thread
your audio code is running on very high priority.</p>
<h2 id="things-to-avoid-if-possible">Things to avoid if possible</h2>
<ol>
<li>Branching: If and switch statements are expensive. The compiler is
clever however, and may optimize the conditional to a branchless
conditional during compilation. All the same, it is best to avoid the
conditional or move it to outside the render loop if it is not
absolutely required.</li>
<li>Trig: The built in trig functions are not performant. Also, the
built in math library typically leaves it to the user to implement some
trig operators in terms of the few operators they do define using trig
identities. This result in even slower operators. If possible, these
functions should be re-implemented using interpolated look-up tables or
cheaper approximations. Generation of look-up tables should happen
statically or at compile time.</li>
<li>Division: It's slower than multiplication.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="things-to-do">Things to do</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="SIMD%20vectorization.html">SIMD vectorization</a>: If
possible, vectorizing code will make it go much much faster.</li>
<li>Pre-compute as much as possible and store the state for later. (ex.
Your <a href="numerically%20controlled%20oscillator.html">numerically
controlled oscillator</a> algorithm doesn't need to know the frequency
when its running, it needs to know the phase increment. If you compute
the phase increment and store it ahead of time you can avoid writing
<code>TWO_PI*freq/sampleRate</code> in your rendering code.)</li>
