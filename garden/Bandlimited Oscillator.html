<p>Within digital audio, a band limited oscillator is any oscillator
algorithm that refrains from producing harmonics above the 1/2 sample
rate limit. It produces no <a href="aliasing">aliasing</a> artifacts.
(see: <a href="Bandlimiting.html">Bandlimiting</a>)</p>
<p>Consider the Fourier expansion a perfect sawtooth wave:</p>
<p>$ y(t) = \frac {1} {2} - \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac {1} {n\pi} sin(2\pi
nt) $</p>
<p>It requires an infinite number of harmonics to create. Even for low
frequency waves, some of those harmonics will alias. As the fundamental
frequency increases the [[aliasing]] distortion will get worse as more
and more harmonics fold over.</p>
<p>This kind of <a href="aliasing.html">aliasing</a> can occur for most
complex waveforms, even those that can be represented with a finite
number of harmonics. At some point on the keyboard they may begin to
alias and distort.</p>
<p>The effect is typically not very pleasing for an oscillator. (it
sounds like crap)</p>
<p>In order to create musically useful complex waves care has to be
taken to ensure that no harmonic content will alias.</p>
<p>Here are some algorithms for generating band-limited waves: - <a

<a href="DSF.html">DSF</a> - <a href="Additve%20Synthesis.html">Additive
Synthesis</a></p>
<p>Sometimes it is not possible or not feasible to band-limit an
oscillator algorithm. (eg. <a href="FM%20Synthesis">FM Synthesis</a>) In
those circumstances <a
href="Quasi-Bandlimited%20Oscillator.md.html">Quasi-Bandlimited</a>
techniques are useful.</p>
<p>Other times band-limiting is not necessary as the generated sound is
noisy and chaotic enough that the aliased harmonics blend in with the
noise. (eg. <a href="White%20Noise.html">White Noise</a>)</p>
