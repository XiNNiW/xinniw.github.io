<h1 id="white-noise">White noise</h1>
<p>White noise is noise that is perfectly random. Ideal white noise has
equal power in all harmonic bands and thus is impossible to physically
create as it would take an infinite amount of energy.</p>
<p>Noise is said to be white when it has approximately equal power in
all available frequency bands.</p>
<p>White noise may be filtered to produce other colors or noise such as
<a href="Pink%20noise">Pink noise</a> and <a
href="Brown%20noise.html">Brown noise</a>.</p>
