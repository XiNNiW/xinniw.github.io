<p>I find this set of specs fascinating given what Live was able to
achieve on this platform. Version 1.5 of Live has a surprising amount of
workflow in common with the current version of Abelton Live (v.11 at the
time of writing).</p>
<h4 id="features-already-present-in-v-1.5">Features already present in v
1.5:</h4>
<ul>
<li>mixing (panning, summing, sends)</li>
<li>real-time audio stretching and sampling</li>
<li>the famous session view -&gt; arrangement view -&gt; session view
workflow</li>
<li>vst audio effects</li>
</ul>
<p>Notably missing was midi sequencing and therefor VSTi's although I
don't think this omission was due to any performance restrictions.
Multitrack recording was added in version 2, and midi control in 3,
virtual instruments in 4.</p>
<p>Looking through the version requirements of subsequent versions of
Live we get through live 6 before we see a change in processor speed
requirement. The most rapid bloat in requirements seems to come in the
form of required ram.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Live 6</p>
<p>Mac: OSX: 10.3.9 (10.4 recommended) CPU: G3 RAM: 512 MB QuickTime 6.5
recommended</p>

<p>PC: WIN: 95/98/NT 4.0/2000 CPU: 300 MHz RAM: 64 MB DirectX or ASIO
compatible soundcard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How much of this increase in RAM consumption was driven by the
graphical environment and how much was driven by increasing audio
requirements? I suspect that the graphical environment is the main
driver. One hint is that the windows specs consistently require 1/2 the
amount of RAM as the Mac versions.</p>
<p>What features were dropped in later versions because the performance
benefits they offered became obsolete with faster hardware?</p>
