<h1 id="digital-sampling">Digital Sampling</h1>
<p>Sound (and analogous signals) are represented inside the computer in
the form of samples. A sample is a snapshot of the signal's amplitude
value at a given point in time. These samples are collected at regular
intervals. The speed at which the samples are collected is called the
sample rate.</p>
<p>A signal is represented as a long stream of these sample values. (for
example: <code>[0 0.2 0.22 -0.1 -0.02 -0.5 -1 -0.66 ...]</code> could be
a signal inside the computer.)</p>
<p>The stream of sample values is converted to real sound (ie. pressure
waves in the air) by a Digital Audio Converter (<a
href="DAC.html">DAC</a>) coupled with an amplifier and speaker. The DAC
takes the sampled values and creates a smooth, continuous analog voltage
by interpolating between the sample values using sinusoidal waves. This
voltage is then typically amplified and fed to a speaker.</p>
<p>The sample rate affects what kinds of sounds can be accurately
recorded and reproduced. Nyquist's sampling theorem states that the
highest frequency that can be accurately represented by a sampled
recording is 1/2 the sampling rate. In modern computers, 44.1 kHz, 48
kHz, and 96 kHz are the most common sampling rates. If sample values
fluctuate at more than 1/2 the sample rate, the tone will <a

of the signal.</p>
