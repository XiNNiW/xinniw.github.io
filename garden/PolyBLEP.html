<h1 id="polyblep">PolyBLEP</h1>
<p>PolyBLEP (which stands for polynomial bandlimited step) is a
technique for anti-aliasing. <a href="aliasing.html">Aliasing</a> occurs
when a signal contains frequency components that are higher than the
Nyquist limit of 1/2 the sample rate. Sudden discontinuities in
waveforms (like those found in classic analog waveforms like saw and
square) theoretically contain an infinite amount of harmonics. Naive
implementations of these shapes will certainly alias in ways that are
audible. PolyBLEP reduces the aliasing associated with these
discontinuities by replacing them with smoother polynomial segments.
This method does not totally eliminate aliasing but can reduce it
dramatically for the most sensitive areas of hearing.</p>
<p>This differs form other methods of band-limiting such as the
bandlimited integrated pulse (<a href="BLIT">BLIT</a>) and the discrete
summation function (<a href="DSF.html">DSF</a>) inthat it computes only
the sharp transition regions as polynomials and replaces them using a
piecewise function of time.</p>
