<h1 id="non-causal-filter">Non-Causal Filter</h1>
<p>A non-causal filter is a digital filter that relies on future input
values. (thus non-causal) It requires a system that has some latency to
have future values in memory to work with. (it has no crystal ball)
Non-causal equations can be used to model filters that would be
impossible or too costly to implement as <a href="FIR%20filter">FIR</a>
