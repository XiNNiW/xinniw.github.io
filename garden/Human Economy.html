<p>A human economy is one where money is used primarily as a way of
reorganizing social relationships and not as a means of exchanging goods
and services. The term was coined by David Graeber in his book <a
href="Toward%20an%20Anthropological%20Theory%20of%20Value">Toward an
Anthropological Theory of Value</a>. He continued to write about the
idea in <a href="Debt:%20The%20First%205,000%20years">Debt:the first
5,000 years</a> and his essay <a
href="All%20Economies%20Are%20Ultimately%20Human%20Economies.html">All
Economies Are Ultimately Human Economies</a>.</p>
