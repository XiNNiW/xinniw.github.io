<h1 id="generative-justice">Generative Justice</h1>
<p>A term coined by Ron Eglash to describe a kind of economic ecology
that does not alienate or extract value. Similar to the concept of a
circular economy. However, Generative Justice is more holistic,
including cultural and social value in its circulation.</p>
<pre><code>For all three categories (labor value, ecological value, and expressive value) we can define generative justice as follows:

The universal right to generate unalienated value and directly participate in its benefits; the rights of value generators to create their own conditions of production; and the rights of communities of value generation to nurture self-sustaining paths for its circulation.</code></pre>

<h2 id="notes-on-algorithmic-pattern-talk-with-alex-mclean">notes on
algorithmic pattern talk (with Alex McLean)</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Innocence" among researchers... "since we are simulating cultural
patterns for science not for profit we don't need to ask
permission"</li>
<li>platforms extract cultural knowledge without consent... often for
profit (advertising)</li>
<li>Eglash's culturally situated design tools take a different approach
<ul>
<li>asks permission...</li>
<li>seeks to see the pattern from the situated, local point of view</li>
<li>accepts education (which is broader than the pattern and may include
local ecology)</li>
<li>seeks to loop value back into the community, running workshops,
financial support</li>
</ul></li>
<li>we need to redefine algorithm... and algorithm is like a recipe in
the sense that it describes information relationships over time
(including human and non-human actors)...</li>
<li>we can distinguish extractive (one-way relationships) vs. Generative
(multi-way relationships)</li>
<li>Example extractive: bitcoin extracts what should be public good to
convert it to private wealth</li>
<li>Example of generative: Navajo weavers and their patterns... a local
economy of weavers exchanging patterns... the inverse-aliasing patterns
are related to the high diversity of plants where the sheep are
herded... the sheep eat all the plants and move the seeds to the
coral.... its a relational economy of giving back
<ul>
<li>high entropy and low entropy parts... Represented in the jagged
lines</li>
<li>produces un-alienated value</li>
</ul></li>
<li>our minds are colonized... we don't see that we how extractive our
economies are...
<ul>
<li>we are extracting ecological value</li>
<li>we are extracting social value</li>
<li>we are extracting labor value</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is it all capitalism's fault... sort of... but state-run
bureaucratic "communism" was just as extractive... "read their
textbooks"</li>
<li>Indigenous communities are better examples on non-extractive
economies</li>
<li>people are jerks everywhere... Indigenous cultures have creates
systems for preventing "jerkiness"</li>
<li>we have trouble recognizing Indigenous algorithms</li>
<li>CSDT: after making sure they are accessible they have put them
online and provided ways for the young people in these communities to
create new algorithms...</li>
<li>Anishinabe woodworkers... Bezier curves inspired by the way wood
bends... Bezier expropriated the value and took credit... the Anishinabe
credited the wood "the wood taught us"</li>
<li>Capitalism has come up with a way to make the extraction
invisible... the Indigenous tradition do the opposite... you spend 4
hours plaiting someones hair to show the labor value</li>
<li>ways to authenticate the labor value...</li>
<li>Eglash's grad student made an AI algorithm to tell the difference
between fake and real kente cloth... AND link the person who is buying
the cloth from the person who made the cloth... Artisans can be paid for
workshops ... and artisans economy. africanfuturist.org</li>

<h3 id="navajo-weaving-geometry">navajo weaving geometry</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>navajo idea: inverse aliasing on lines (emphasizing
jaggedness)</p></li>
<li><p>non-euclidean 30 degree grids</p></li>
<li><p>grown to dislike the word holism and its synonyms (eg.
Entanglement)... Everything is entangled ... bitcoin is entangled but in
a destructive way... If you characterize these generative algorithms as
high entropy you miss the point... it can also lead to appeals to
naturalism... this can be dangerous... eg. "only certain kinds o
sexuality are natural"... he prefers discussing the modulation between
high and low entropy</p></li>
<li><p>modulations in entropy... we need to be able to grap this with
simple terms... but it can't stop there... it then needs to be
qualified/complexified</p></li>
<li><p>Anishinabe bead patterns... Multiple species on the same vine...
a form of resistance against cultural suppression... a belief that all
these plants are connected (and indeed they are... calorie
sharing...)... a pharmacopoeia</p></li>
<li><p>McLean: "a heritage practice is always innovating because
everything made is unique... Infinite possibilities... even though we
think about them as something that needs to be preserved"</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reparations-generative">reparations (generative)</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I don't spend a lot of time talking about critique"... Reparations
requires it... lots of people who are better at this kind of critique
and are making it...</li>
<li>however, what form should reparations take? cultural similarity
between Black and Indigenous communities... a vested interest in
repairing the world... for example, if reparations are to come in the
form of land we should recognize that the land was stolen in the first
place...</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scale">scale</h3>
<ul>
<li>students will say, Dr. Eglash you are doing it wrong.. you are
working with local artisans but so small... you need to do generative
justice at scale... change the world like elon musk or mark zuk...
ect...</li>
<li>Ford had a good thing going until he tried to scale it... thats when
it became disastrous...</li>
<li>you have to start small and make sure that what you are doing is not
destructive and THEN grow</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-note-on-david-graeber">a note on david graeber</h2>
<ul>
<li>legal barriers to get a communal car for a commune. the state
demands that someone owns it... lol</li>
<li>there is legal work to do to allow for shared ownership/authorship
for example</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-question-about-value">a question about value</h2>
<ul>
<li>these communities already have value... how do you make it fungible?
this is interesting...</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-note-about-choice">a note about choice</h2>
<ul>
<li>when using CSDT... the people in the community must be able to
choose which tools they use, what changes they make</li>
<li>this is part of decolonization</li>
