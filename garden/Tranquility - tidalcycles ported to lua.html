<p>announced Tranquility on the tidalcycles forum and asked for help
with my cooperative multitasking question...</p>
<h3 id="section-1">2023-02-10</h3>
<p>I'm pretty sure its my implementation of Pattern that is the problem
and not the <code>LinkClock</code>. I made the thread sleep super long
and it actually waited to send the osc message... I think when
<code>onsetsOnly</code> is called it thinks that every moment inside of
<code>Pure("gabba")</code> has an onset...</p>
<h3 id="section-2">2023-02-16</h3>
<p>I wrote unit tests to isolate the problem with the pattern
implementation. For a while it looked like I had exposed the problem.
The test revealed events coming back after <code>onsetOnly</code>
filtering even though part and whole would have different onsets... this
would cause the pattern to behave like a continuous signal and cause the
chainsaw kicks I was hearing in superdirt</p>
<p>However, I had been careless in the way I wrote the test. After I
fixed my mistake it passed. I'm back to the drawing board on the
problem. I am now convinced it must be a problem in the scheduler.</p>
<p>Here is what I know... the thread is sleeping as expected... the
pattern created by <code>Pure</code> behaves as expected and has only
one onset at the beginning of the cycle.</p>
<p>This leads me to believe that it is being queried incorrectly... for
example, the scheduler may be repeatedly asking for the beginning of the
cycle and thus is repeatedly returning the onset...</p>
<p>AHA! found it... it's because I didn't make the convenience
constructor for fraction that converts decimal numbers to the closest
fractional representation... the <code>LinkClock</code> queries the
<code>notifyTick</code> method with decimal numbers... these are
interpreted as the nearest whole cycle...</p>
<h3 id="section-3">2023-03-20</h3>
<p>Finally finished an implementation of fast, slow, and cat. How to
make it possible to interact with the system over a repl given lua's
single threaded nature is still a puzzle</p>
