<h1 id="climate-crisis">Climate Crisis</h1>
<p>:cc0: The climate crisis is the human caused warming of the planet
and all potential ramifications of that warming. The name is apt as we
are running out of time to avert the worst consequences.</p>
<h2 id="global-warming">global warming</h2>
<p>This warming effect is primarily caused by humans releasing
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun
and prevent it from being reflected back out into space. Primary sources
of greenhouse gas emission include the burning of fossil fuels, and the
mass farming of meat for human consumption.</p>
<h2 id="consequences">consequences</h2>
<p>Small increases in average temperature globally can have devastating
consequences on ecosystems and potentially cause <a
href="catastrophic%20runaway%20warming.html">catastrophic runaway
warming</a> that would render our planet inhabitable by most life.</p>
<h2 id="survival-is-incompatible-with-our-way-of-living">survival is
incompatible with our way of living</h2>
<p>Most activities of modern life are deeply entwined with the emission
of greenhouse gas. (For example, power generation, transportation,
mining, industrial agriculture, technology and computing. (see: <a
href="climate%20impact%20of%20technology.html">climate impact of
technology</a>)</p>
<p>Mutual survival will likely require changing most everything about
the way that we live and redressing our species' relationship with its
surroundings.</p>
