<h1 id="fighting-game-mechanics">fighting game mechanics</h1>
<ul>
<li>a character where their attack power increases as they are
damaged</li>
<li>but their moves slow down</li>
<li>vampire character/ werewolf</li>
<li>health draining attacks</li>
<li>combo traditional fighter / platform fighter .. how would we change
the format without changing the mechanics?</li>
<li>once you get low health you get buff you can spend on unique special
attack</li>
<li>characters with whips</li>
<li>a character who grows vines and roots to attack... they act as
shields</li>
<li>a grab that works at range</li>
<li>dead cells war javelin (weapon you teleport to)</li>
<li>puppet character</li>
<li>a character where after you land a certain number of combos you
transform ... attacks in stronger mode drain your HP... have to use a
special to exit.. then you get some health back...</li>
<li>if you get all of a certian item you transform.. insane damage but
constantly losing health</li>
<li></li>
<li>more interplay between main character and puppet</li>
<li>puppet character has to spend a resource to set up a move with the
puppet but then the puppet uses that same resource when they move as a
balance</li>
<li>special the main character has... when they are close enough to the
puppet the move is cancelled and the main character does a special
move... you can set up a combo sacrificing the main characters movement
to hasten the recovery
<ul>
<li>explicitly summon the puppet</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
