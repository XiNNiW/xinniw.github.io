<p>Non-linear note-taking is the idea of recording your thoughts in a
way that allows you to navigate them in non-sequential ways. For
example, a daily log written sequentially in a notebook is linear in
time. A <a href="digital%20garden">digital garden</a>, personal wiki, or
<a href="zettlekeston.html">zettlekeston</a> is organized by connections
between ideas. New connections can be made as the documents are written.
This is an example of non-linear note-taking.</p>
