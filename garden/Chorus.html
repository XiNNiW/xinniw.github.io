<p>:cc0: The chorus is a repeated section of a song that usually
contains its most exciting and memorable lyrical and melodic material.
It typically has shorter, more frequently repeated phrases.</p>
<p>The most interesting choruses, to me, are ones that change content
and structure over time. This could be the substitution of lyrics,
introduction of new lyrics, change in length, change in register.</p>
