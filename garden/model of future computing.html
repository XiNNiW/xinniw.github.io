id="permacomputing-modelling-the-future-of-computing">Permacomputing:
Modelling the future of computing</h1>
<p>The design of computational systems that can be preserved into the
far future, like any design problem, is predicated on a set of
expectations about the future. These expectations inform the design
requirements and the scenarios against which a candidate design must be
tested.</p>
<p>Discussions about permacomputing that I have observed tend to assume
one of the following models of the future.</p>
<h1 id="collapse">Collapse</h1>
<p>A popular model to assume is one of complete civilizational collapse.
In this future, the complex supply chains that underpin modern computing
are destroyed by some combination of climate instability, war, famine,
pandemic or some other such host of apocalyptic problems. Computers, in
so far as they are still used, must be entirely scavenged from existing
machines. Through hole components would be prized in this scenario as
they are easiest to de-solder.</p>
<p>A designer operating under this set of assumptions would likely
design for the performance profile of 8bit computers of the 80's as this
models the kind of hardware that would be available for easy scavenging.
In addition to severely limiting the required operating specifications,
she might also consider targeting a small lightweight virtual machine
that could be ported to some improvised computer hardware with minimal
effort.</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="moores-law-forever">Moore's Law Forever</h1>
<p>Another popular model is to assume that Moore's law continued
unabated into the distant future. This model has been prevalent in
popular discourse surrounding the future of technology for many years.
This model is often an underpinning assumption made by futurists
interested in AI, singularity, other imagined futures where
computational power becomes a god-like force.</p>
<p>A designer operating under this vision of the future need not limit
themselves in any way as computers of the future will be arbitrarily
powerful.</p>
<p>This view of Moore's law seems increasingly implausible as the
trajectory of computational power has sagged in recent decades.</p>
<p>A more careful designer who still assumes a future of increasingly
powerful machines would still need to make considerations that limit the
complexity of their design. In this future, the tools of the past would
be unable to run, not because sufficient hardware is unavailable, but
because the secrets required to build and extend its tooling have been
forgotten. This designer may therefor still choose to place hard limits
on the software she designs with the goal of making it possible for
people in the far future to emulate her computational environment
without undue effort.</p>
<h1 id="a-3rd-model-responsible-design">A 3rd model: Responsible
design</h1>
<p>To this set I would like to include a 3rd model. In this vision of
the future, we come to our senses and realize that we must radically
alter our behavior in order to survive as a species. As part of this
change, we realize that manufacturing every more powerful and
complicated computers (which consumes ever greater amounts resources),
only to throw them away a few years into their useful life to replace
them with newer, even more complicated machines, is not sustainable.</p>
<p>If this cycle of obsolescence was broken, what might we do
instead?</p>
<p>If we were to prioritize impact on our shared environment while still
continuing to use computers in our lives, we would likely design these
devices to last as long as possible, repair them when they broke, and
design software to run on an extremely large number of possible hardware
platforms. How long would a computer need to last in order to mitigate
the environmental impact of its manufacture? For the sake of argument,
lets say that this figure is 25 years.</p>
<p>In this world, software designers would seek to avoid inadvertently
forcing an end user to replace a working computer with a faster one.
They might do this in the following ways: - Designing for some absolute
minimum set of specifications - Designing graceful fail-overs for
complicated features</p>
<p>Here too, the idea of designing against some minimal virtual machine
is appealing as it enables support for a wider variety of hardware
platforms.</p>
