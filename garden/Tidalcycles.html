<h1 id="tidalcycles">Tidalcycles</h1>
<p><a href="http://tidalcycles.org/">Tidalcycles</a> is a music
livecoding environment created by Alex Maclean. Tidalcycles is concerned
with the creation and manipulation of musical pattern. Tidal defines a
pattern as a function mapping time to events. The tidal library consists
of functions that can be composed together in various ways to change the
way that events are mapped to time. Tidal contains a "mini-notation"
that allows to musician to create cyclical rhythmic patterns. The
concept for mini-notation grew out of a part of the <a
href="https://bolprocessor.org/.html">bol processor</a> that was meant
to notate tabla rhythms from Indian Classical music. By default, it
encourages the user to subdivide time in ways that are more commonly
found in Indian Classical music.</p>
