<h1 id="practice-advice-guitar">Practice Advice (Guitar)</h1>
<p>I have gotten advice from various people on practicing the guitar.
Here it is in no particular order.</p>
<h4 id="play-slowly">Play slowly</h4>
<p>when learning things go at a fraction of the tempo you mean to play
it at. Play with a click track and nail it at a slow tempo before moving
on.</p>
<h4 id="watch-your-form-chronic-injury">Watch your form/ chronic
injury</h4>
<p>Use form that will help you continue to play through your life. Don't
hurt yourself. A big part of this on stringed instruments is to not
bend/contort your wrist as you play. (to the extent that this is
possible) Pay attention to your wrist and adjust your grip so that you
can straiten it out.</p>
<h4 id="when-you-stop-improving-quickly-practice-something-else">When
you stop improving quickly, practice something else</h4>
<p>in a particular practice session, when you notice the rate of you
improvement slow considerably, take a break or go practice some other
part of your playing. You tend to learn things best in spurts. After a
bit, your rate of returns diminishes when you keep drilling the same
thing. You make better use of your practice time if you move on when you
notice that diminishing.</p>
<h4 id="use-a-metronome-record-yourself">Use a metronome/ Record
yourself</h4>
<p>I used to hate playing with a metronome. To this day, if I don't have
one on hand and in front of me I wont use it. However, it makes a huge
difference to your playing and will help you be rhythmically tighter and
teach to control your rhythm. Even better is if you record yourself and
listen back, noting what you want to improve next time. This makes
studio recording one of the best ways to practice your playing.</p>
<h4 id="remember-to-practice-it-standing-up">Remember to practice it
standing up</h4>
<p>I had a guitar teacher in high-school who was the coolest. A super
practical piece of advice from him about performing. Remember to play
your tunes standing up. If you only practice sitting down your body will
not be ready to play out at a show standing in front of an audience. It
sounds super simple because it is. It is also really useful advice.</p>
