<p>This resembles something you sometimes see with popular API's which
are available in a number of programming languages. This happens
frequently with libraries that facilitate communication over some kind
of common protocol. For example, Google's GRPC protocal provides
libraries that have similar or identical API's in many programming
languages as the Tx and Rx may be running programs written in different
languages.</p>
<p>Tidal is a kind of domain specific language which is similar and
related to the idea of API. Translating a DSL to another programming
language is a bit like implementing the same API in another programming
language. We have equivalent methods, objects, and data-structures to
the extent that the host programming language allows.</p>
<p>This allows the programmer to use the same, or very similar
expressions, to denote the same end behavior to the computer even though
the way it is executed may be radically different. (For example: the
machine code that is run for a strudel pattern vs. a tidal pattern would
look nothing like one another)</p>

- observed qualitative differences between tidal and its
translations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Frege: two phrases in natural languages that denote the same thing
may not have the same meaning...</li>
</ul>
<p>In translating computer code from one language to another this does
not, at first seem to be the case. However, I wonder if it depends on
where we think the meaning is coming from. For example if tidal's
<code>d1 $ cat [s "bd", fast 3 $ s "sd"]</code> and strudel's
<code>cat([ s("bd"), s("sd").fast(3)])</code> do not produce the same
sounds, one of the systems would be said to be broken. It would be
treated as a bug or malfunction.</p>
<p>From perspective of the improviser these two expressions require
different physical actions and different mental framing to reproduce. In
the case of tidal, the pattern flows outward and to the left. The
patterns are born inside the brackets and are transformed on their way
leftward to the code <code>d1</code> where the system receives them and
plays them back. In the strudel example, the patterns flow outward and
to the right and they do not reach any terminating point. Strudel also
requires more parentheses as it lacks Haskell's <code>$</code> operator.
This is a bit like a righthanded guitar vs. a left-handed guitar.</p>
<p>What is preserved through the difference in syntax seems to be the
relationship between functions.</p>
<p>Something that is different is the way that the computer interprets
the instructions (even if they sound the same).</p>
<p>perhaps this is a bit like having two character sets that represent
the same spoken language?</p>
<p>perhaps this is like</p>
