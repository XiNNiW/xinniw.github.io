<h1 id="the-dawn-of-everything-by-david-graeber-and-david-wengrow">The
Dawn Of Everything by David Graeber and David Wengrow</h1>
<p>The Dawn of everything seeks to tell a sweeping history of human
society based on the latest archaeological evidence. In doing so, it
seeks to replace the sweeping histories that dominate our narratives of
our species. Most histories of human social organization start with an
ends first perspective that frames all historical events as leading
inexorably toward our present. (large nation states marked by
inequality, and domination) These events are often framed as being
purely technologically determined and almost never frame them as the
product of self-concious political decision making. The authors show
that this sweeping narrative of human society "running headlong into its
chains" is dissonant with the anthropological and archaeological record.
They lament that almost no-one in their respective fields (archaeology
and anthropology) is writing work that synthesizes the evidence into a
broad narrative. Meanwhile, academics outside their fields write
histories that retell a largely evolutionary story of human
society.<br />
The evidence shows a kaleidoscopic array of forms of human social
organization, driven by self-concious experimentation as much as it is
by technology and agriculture. Abandoning this teleological myth of
human development and engaging with the evidence is important for our
collective ability to imagine a future for our species.</p>

of the evolutionary model of human social organization</h2>
<ul>
<li>The evolutionary model of the development of human society has been
widely discredited as "myth-making".</li>
<li>Most authors within the field are hesitant to make any sweeping
claims at all however still write as if a society is mostly determined
by its mode of subsistence.</li>
<li>Authors outside the field seem to be stuck in a mode of either
reiterating Hobbes or Rousseau. Neither Hobbes nor Rousseau were writing
from a place of evidence and their assertions about "man in the original
state of nature" is more of a theological argument than a</li>

<h2
id="why-asking-what-is-the-origin-of-social-inequality-is-the-wrong-question">why
asking "what is the origin of social inequality?" is the wrong
question</h2>
<ul>
<li>the anthropological record cannot agree on what is meant by social
equality/inequality</li>
<li>"egalitarian" societies sometimes contain staggering in-equality
between men and women in domestic life</li>
<li>many societies switch their mode of organization depending on time
of year or activity</li>
<li>its a better question to ask where this question came from...</li>

effect of the indigenous critique of European society on the so called
"Enlightenment"</h3>
<ul>
<li>How political arguments of Kondiaronk became a best selling book in
Europe and influenced Enlightenment thinkers like Rousseau</li>
<li>These ideas inspired backlash from enlightenment thinkers like
Turgot. This backlash shaped many of the ideas of economic
liberalism.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rousseau-and-the-myth-of-the-stupid-savage">Rousseau and the
myth of the "stupid savage"</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rousseau is often accused of inventing the "noble savage" trope. In
his essay on the origins of social inequality he imagines man in a state
of nature....</li>
<li>Graeber and Wengrow that, while it is problematic to treat the
philosophical ideas of indigenous societies as mystical, ineffable
wisdom, it is more problematic to rob indigenous societies and their
philosophers of their agency by insisting that these societies were not
making self-concious political decisions and criticising anyone who
suggests that they were as invoking the "noble savage" trope.</li>
</ul>
<h2
id="criticism-of-technological-determinism---how-the-agriculture-revolution-didnt-happen">criticism
of technological determinism - how the agriculture revolution didn't
happen</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors write about social organization as if it is entirely
determined by a given societies mode of subsistence. "Egalitarian"
societies are possible for small hunter-gatherer bands but as soon as
agriculture shows up these societies are "running into their
chains"</li>
<li>This is dissonant with archaeological evidence with suggests that
societies experimented on and off with agriculture well ahead of
evidence of centralized control</li>
<li>According to archaeological evidence the agricultural revolution
took some 3000 years. This is a very slow pace for a "revolution". It is
also much longer than what.</li>
<li>Most early implementations of farming did not lend themselves to the
development of private property. Flood-retreat farming.</li>

domination</h3>

<li>control of violence</li>
<li>control of information</li>
<li>charismatic politics</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-origin-of-kings">the origin of kings</h3>
<ul>
<li>the beginning of kingdoms are punctuated by events of enormous
violence</li>
<li>typically this takes the form of ritual sacrifice of loyal retainers
and hundreds to thousands of victims, usually women, whose bodies are
sometimes mutilated and buried with the king and his retainers. The
retainers are sacrificed so they may accompany the king into the
afterlife (so he will remain a king in the next world). The victims,
sometimes war captives, sometimes chosen apparently at random, serve to
provide the fledgling kingdom with its subjects by robbing surviving
family of a way of honoring their ancestors without honoring the
king.</li>
<li>kingship, and sovereignty more generally, is marked by a confluence
of violence and care.</li>
<li>care makes the king a king. his retainers feed him, cloth him, cut
his hair, and ritualize his daily existence.</li>
<li>kings almost invariably proclaim themselves the defenders of orphans
and widows. Their courts are populated by those who are not able to get
care elsewhere. In this way, these people lose their freedom to move
away. By losing this first elemental freedom, the lose the second, the
freedom to disobey. In order to receive care they are compelled to carry
out the king's commands however violent or objectionable.</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="why-asking-what-is-the-origin-of-the-state-is-the-wrong-question">why
asking "what is the origin of the state?" is the wrong question</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>no one can seem to agree on what is meant by a state</p></li>
<li><p>living in cities does not imply a state as there is a long record
of urban life without state-like control</p></li>
<li><p>histories of civilizations tend to tacitly assume an evolutionist
model where our modern nation state is seen as the inevitable
evolutionary outcome...</p></li>
<li><p>the state as we currently imagine it was not inevitable as,
pre-invasion and colonization, North America had largely done away with
its most state-like social structures.</p>
<h4 id="st-3nd-and-3rd-order-societies">1st, 3nd, and 3rd order
societies</h4></li>
<li><p>Graeber and Wengrow propose instead that we speak of a society
based on which forms of domination predominate its social life.</p></li>
