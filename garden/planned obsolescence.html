<p># Planned Obsolescence</p>
<p>Planned obsolescence is where a manufacturer of a product engineers
it in some way that will require it to be replaced with a new version of
the same product after a period of time so as to ensure the generation
of new sales. This may be driven by restriction of repair, deliberate
reduction in quality, and/or changes in proprietary adaptors and
protocols.</p>
