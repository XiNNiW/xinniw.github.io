<h1 id="iir-filter">IIR Filter</h1>
<p>An Infinite Impulse Response filter is a digital filter implemented
by a difference equation that included references, not only to past
inputs, but also to pas output values. A general form for the equation
would be as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y[n] = \sum_{i=0}^p a_{i}x[n-i] +
\sum_{j=0}^q b_{j}y[n-j] \]</span></p>
<p>IIR filters are not guaranteed to be stable or to preserve phase
relationships. However, it is possible to achieve steep cutoff responses
with very few terms.</p>
