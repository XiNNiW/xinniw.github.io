<h1 id="pairing">Pairing</h1>
<p>Originating as part of the <em>Extreme Programming</em> software
development practice popularized by Kent Beck, pairing is where two
people complete a task while sharing the tool used to complete that
task. It is two minds mono-focused on a single goal, working together to
reach it. In paired programming, two engineers share a keyboard and
mouse, passing it back and forth as they write the software.</p>
<p>There are numerous benefits of this practice that can be thought of
in terms of business value. I want to focus on how pairing affects the
creative process.</p>
