<h1 id="mortal-computation">Mortal Computation</h1>
<p>Mortal Computation is the idea that, in an analog computer, the
computation dies with the hardware. I first heard this described in a
paper about the forward forward machine learning algorithm by Geoff
Hinton. He claims his FF algorithm could be implemented directly on
silicon, with inputs represented as voltages and weights represented as
conductances. This would be more energy efficient than simulating this
circuit's behavior on a general purpose computer or doing a lot of ADC
DAC conversion. He also claims that this chip would be more energy
efficient to manufacture.</p>
