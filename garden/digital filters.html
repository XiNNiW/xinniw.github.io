<h1 id="digital-filter">Digital Filter</h1>
<p>A digital filter is a process that takes some input signal and
produces some (possibly modified) output signal. In that way almost
everything that interacts with an audio signal inside the computer is a
digital filter.</p>
<p>Filters can be used to subtract or add frequency components of input
signals, as well as manipulate the phase of those frequency
components.</p>
<h2 id="common-types-of-filters">common types of filters</h2>
<p>Common types of filters are names based on their effect on incoming
frequencies.</p>
<h3 id="lowpass">lowpass</h3>
<p>It lets through the low frequencies and attenuates the high
frequencies.</p>
<h3 id="highpass">highpass</h3>
<p>It lets through the high frequencies and attenuates the low
frequencies.</p>
<h3 id="bandpass">bandpass</h3>
<p>Both high and low frequencies are attenuated and some set of middle
frequencies are allowed to pass.</p>
<h3 id="notch">notch</h3>
<p>Both high and low frequencies are allowed to pass and some middle
band of frequencies is attenuated.</p>
<h3 id="allpass">allpass</h3>
<p>No frequencies are attenuated but the phase relationships are
changed.</p>
<h3 id="comb">comb</h3>
<p>The signal is combined with a delayed version of itself to create
phase cancellation. This mimics the effect created when a sound bounces
off of a surface.</p>
<h2 id="filter-design">filter design</h2>
<p>Most filters can be thought of as dynamical systems and discrete
versions mathematical techniques for analyzing differential equations
can be applied to analyze the behavior of the filter system to input.
Typically, it is interesting to know the following about a filter: 1.
How the system will respond to a unit impulse 2. Under what conditions
its output is stable, semi-stable, and unstable 3. How incoming
frequencies will be affected (ie. its frequency response) 4. How the
phase of incoming signals will be affected 5. How to calculate
parameters or coefficients for the filter from more intuitive quantities
(such as cutoff frequency and resonance)</p>
<p>Answering the above typically involves designing a filter in state
space and deriving its difference equation by taking the inverse Z
transform. For Linear Time Invariant filters this operation is easy as
<span class="math inline">\(Z_{-1}(\sum_{i=0}^p a_{i}Y_{n-i}) =
\sum_{i=0}^p a_{i}y[n-i]\)</span> If the filter is not a Linear Time
Invariant Filter the power series must be solved or referenced from a
lookup table.</p>
