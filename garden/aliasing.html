<h1 id="aliasing">Aliasing</h1>
<p>Aliasing is where a digital signal (or some component of a signal)
fluctuates at a frequency higher than 1/2 the sampling rate. For
example, assuming a sampling rate of 48 kHz, any tone or harmonic higher
than 22 kHz will alias. The energy of the aliased tone will then be
reflected downward in pitch into potentially audible side-bands. The
result is typically the introduction of high-pitched in-harmonic tones
to the signal. Sometimes this effect is <a
href="sample%20rate%20reduction.html">desirable</a>. Most often it is
not desirable.</p>
<p>Consider the following signal: <code>[0 1 0 -1 0]</code> Upon output,
the <a href="DAC.html">DAC</a> will interpolate between these points
using a sinusoidal wave. The result will be a tone at 1/4 the sample
rate as its period is 4 samples long.</p>
<p>Imagine that we tried to generate a signal that was 3/4 the sample
rate. The values that we would sample would be as follows:
<code>[0 1 0 -1 0]</code></p>
<p>Its the same signal and would result in a tone 1/4 of the sample
rate. Any signal component that fluctuates faster than 1/2 the sample
rate will result in a copy or alias of that component of a lower
pitch.</p>
<p>What would happen if we tried to generate a signal at the sample
rate? If the wave started at precisely the same moment as the first
sample we would end up with the following signal:
<code>[0 0 0 0]</code>. Every time we record the value, the wave is at
the same position as it started. If it were perfectly out of phase with
the first sample: <code>[1 -1 1 -1]</code>.</p>
<p>This effect has analogues in video and other sampled mediums. Our
example above is the audio equivalent of a wheel rotating at the frame
rate of the camera. It appears in the footage to be completely
still.</p>
