<h1 id="chiptune">Chiptune</h1>
<p>Chiptune is a musical genre that includes and is inspired by the
music that was composed for early videogame systems using early sound
synthesizer chips with limited voices and limited sound options. For
example, the SID chip had only 4 voices (a pulse, a saw, a noise
generator, and a triangle wave). Because early chips had these
limitations, the music often makes heavy use of arpeggiation to outline
harmony. Modern chiptune may choose to ignore these limitations and
instead using these voice saving techniques, and sound palettes,
stylistically. Many chiptune songs have a sense of nostalgia,
referencing playful experiences that many listeners had, or imagined
that they had, in childhood. Vaporwave music will sometimes make use of
chiptune textures, self consciously referencing this nostalgia in a way
that disorients it; placing it near sampled sounds from advertisements,
corporate training videos, and other ironically reclaimed sounds.</p>
