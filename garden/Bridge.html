<h1 id="bridge">Bridge</h1>
<p>In a <a href="Pop%20song%20form.html">pop song</a>, the bridge is an
optional section that adds variation after the listener has heard the
main structure of the song. It usually is made to contrast the material
in the rest of the song as a way to add interest. It usually sits
between the last two choruses of the song.</p>
