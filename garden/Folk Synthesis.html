<p>This is made up or at least its speculative. What does it look like
to make the creation of electronic music widely accessible? It might
seem like we already know the answer to this question. Computing devices
are ubiquitous - although not as evenly distributed as we might imagine.
Many of these devices offer a way to create electronic sound. However,
most commonly available forms of computing are disposable consumer
objects...</p>
<p>What does a ubiquitous electronic music look like when the technology
we use to create it is in balance with our broader ecology? What is a
solarpunk future for synthetic sound?</p>
