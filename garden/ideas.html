<p>"the idea exists independent of language... and that's a problem" -
Cormac McCarthy</p>
<p>What we call AI (various clever machine learning algorithms) might
model something like an unconscious. Not unconsciousness but singular
unconscious'. "Your unconscious just works for you." Not these ones -
these work for other people. The unconscious is also a black box. We do
not know how it comes to its conclusions. It might lead us astray. It,
however, has a vested interest in you. Not these algorithms. They are
unaware you exist. Your unconscious will work the "night-shift" - it
continues while you go about other things. It is also doing those other
things. It's not boiling in the background. It uses these experiences.
Sometimes is uses them to communicate to you.</p>
<p>"The unconscious is a machine for operating an animal. If you didn't
have one, you would just lie there." - Cormac McCarthy</p>
<p>"Obviously animals are intelligent." - Cormac McCarthy</p>
<p>McCarthy is incredibly interested in intelligence. "Why physicists?
Because their smart and smart people are interesting."</p>
<p>McCarthy reminds me a bit of my Uncle Rick...he is bright, sure of
himself. He's sharp and doesn't put up with much bullshit.</p>
<p>"I knew that, life is brief, you're only here once, and to spend so
much of it doing something that someone else tells you to do is not the
way to live it" - McCarthy</p>
<p>Tristan Perich is interested in working with robots and
microcontrollers because of their physicality. Its not the computer or
the world but the interaction between the two.</p>
