<h1 id="debt-the-first-5000-years">Debt (the first 5,000 years)</h1>
<p><em>Debt (the first 5000 years)</em> is a book by anthropologist <a
href="David%20Graeber.html">David Graeber</a> that attempts to make a
comprehensive history of the concept of debt through recorded history.
According to Graeber it may be the first such history of debt ever
written.</p>
<h2 id="big-ideas">Big ideas</h2>
<h3
id="history-of-the-world-as-alternating-hard-currency-and-virtual-currency-epochs">History
of the world as alternating hard currency and virtual currency
epochs</h3>
<p>Graeber divides human history into large periods of time where, all
over the world, and almost all at once, conceptions of money change from
virtual to bullion and back again. The periods of bullion are
characterized by immense violence, the rise of empires, and chattel
slavery. The periods of virtual currency are characterized by the
eradication of chattel slavery, and the rise of moral institutions that
protect debtors.</p>
<p>Graeber argues that history can be split into the following periods
based on dominant global concepts of money: Bronze Age (virtual), The
Axial Age (bullion), The Middle Ages (virtual), Colonialist Era
(bullion), The Modern Era (bullion -&gt; virtual).</p>
<p>The Bronze age operated largely on credit. Some of the earliest
writing that we have access to are calculations of compound interest as
a justification for war. Graeber also presents evidence of bar tabs,
credit instruments, and other forms of virtual money. Large temple
complexes served as a kind of bank, warehouseing goods and keeping stone
tablets that chronicled debts. Kings managed periodic debt crises, where
wealthy merchants forced large portions of the population into debt
peonage, by declaring periodic jubilees where all debts were forgiven
and land was redistributed. The first recorded word for freedom,
<em>amargi</em>, translates to <em>return to mother</em> and is used to
describe these jubilees. Large portions of the population who had fled
the cities into the hinterlands to escape their debts were allowed,
quite literally, to return to their families.</p>
<p>The Axial Age represented a shift toward hard bullion currency.
Markets were created around this bullion when states began to demand
taxes in that currency. This was likely incepted as a mechanism to
maintain (and feed) large standing armies. States paid soldiers in coin
and then demanded taxes in that coin from their subjects. In doing so
they essentially employed all of their subjects in the business of
feeding and providing for soldiers. People taken as prisoners in war
were enslaved and sent to work in the gold and silver mines. This
created a complex that drove the expanse of the worlds first empires.
The worlds great religions spring up around the moral and ethical
problems posed by this materialist position of money.</p>
<p>The Middle Ages mark a return to virtual currency, the outlaw of
usury, and the disappearance of chattel slavery. Credit is seen as
honorable and as an extension of ones trustworthiness. Everyone is in
each other's debts and debts are periodically forgiven. In the middle
east this period gives rise to the worlds first free market ideologies
and is marked by largely peaceful trade. Credit arrangements are managed
by systems of trustworthiness and honor. The State is minimally involved
while religious institutions enforce a moratorium on taking interest.
Risk is understood to be inherent to investment and prices are seen to
be god's will.</p>
<p>Europe during these period is a relatively barbarous backwater.
Almost no hard currency is around, however debts are sometimes measured
in old Roman currency, even though no-one had any. Precious metals
consolidate in the church. Gradually interest taking is made semi-legal.
Merchants use debts to conscript knights into military/plunder/trade
ventures.</p>
<p>The power of wealthy merchants and the monarchy consolidates in the
Enlightenment. Loans from the King are turned into tokens of debt that
can be traded. Charging interest is made legal. Laws are introduced to
enforce payments of debts. Ordinary people now have the power to place
each other in debtors prisons, which, for a poor person, is essentially
a death sentence. Attitudes regarding debt and credit change and debt
and credit are seen as dirty and immoral. By contrast hard currency is
seen as moral. There is very little hard currency in circulation. Paper
debts are circulated as currency, again to fund war/exploitation/trade
ventures. The first joint-stock corporations are combination military
and trade ventures. Debt is used to impel people to join these ventures
and used to manipulate colonized peoples. Chattel slavery is at the
heart of these early capitalist ventures. Debts are used to reduce human
beings to a state where they will do whatever is necessary to pay their
debt no matter the moral consequences. For example, all the
conquistadors were in entrapped in debts that they could not pay.</p>
<p>The Modern era begins with Nixon taking the US off of the gold
standard. The US was one of the last countries to do so and only
switched to alleviate economic problems introduced by its immense war
debts. These war debts were used as a means to underpin the US dollar.
The US empire asks its subjects to back their currency with US treasury
bonds, creating a kind of tributary relationship that pays for further
US military expenditure. The international value of the US dollar in
this schema is directly related to US military supremacy. Money is
created by privately owned banks and regulated by the Federal reserve.
Banks create money by lending out money that they do not physically
possess. Since this money will end up in a bank somewhere this is
considered safe. The fact that banks are allowed to create money and
that the wealthy in general have more or less direct access to it is
obscured by deliberately complex processing surrounding monetary policy.
Graeber argues that if ordinary people understood how money worked, they
would demand that they be included and considered in its creation. This
period is, so far, unusual in that it has been marked by the rise of
global institutions for the protection of creditors. Institutions like
the IMF and the World Bank exist to make sure that no country ever
defaults on its loans. Domestically these protections for creditors are
accompanied by laws making is extraordinarily difficult for ordinary
citizens to declare bankruptcy and the repeal of anti usury laws.
Graeber argues that these policies, and more generally the persistent
attitude that creditors should be protected no matter the cost, to be
insane. He blames it for the periodic and frequent debt crises that have
plagued the US economy for the past 40 years. Credit, Graeber argues,
should carry some element of risk. To make default impossible is to
encourage stupid investment.</p>
<h2 id="debt-as-morality-and-moral-confusion">Debt as morality and
"moral confusion"</h2>
<p>The book begins with what Graeber calls "a moral confusion". It is
common moral sense that "one ought to pay ones debts". Graeber argues
that, in our culture, this is felt to be reflexively true in a way that
we are not fully conscious of. As a result we apply this thinking even
when it doesn't make sense. (For example, when the creditor is clearly
manipulative, or when the debtor is no longer the person who took out
the loan) Popular moral philosophy centers debt and payment of debt as a
concept critical to what morality means. From some perspectives, all
morality is seen as debt.</p>
<p>A history of debt is also a history of money... Also questionable is
the story that economists tell us about the development of money. Most
economics textbooks start out with a common sense history of the
evolution of money that is entirely fabricated. This history always
begins with a barter economy and then introduces <a
href="money.html">money</a> as a way to ease the burden of trading with
a larger number of people with a wider variety of needs. (ex. If your
neighbors neighbor needs chickens but all you have is a cow, you would
need to barter your way to chickens to trade with that person)</p>
<p>According to anthropological/archaeological evidence most human
economies begin with complex credit systems. Debts between neighbors or
merchants were tracked and settled against each other often in the
absence of physical currency.</p>
<h2
id="graebers-schema-for-human-relationships-beyond-exchange">Graeber's
schema for human relationships beyond exchange</h2>
<p>Economists, and many enlightenment thinkers before them, like to
reduce all human relationships to exchange. This kind of thinking is a
conceptual trap and fails to explain the majority of human
relationships. Graeber introduces a schema for human moral
relationships. This schema, like all models, is a fiction. However, this
fiction does a better job of explaining a broader variety of human
relationships and serves as a useful place to begin thinking about such
things. Graeber's schema: human relationships are either a matter of
exchange, hierarchy, or communism.</p>
<p>Exchange relationships are those that are undertaken between two
relatively equal actors where each has something to gain from the other.
Graeber argues that most exchange occurs with people who you don't know
very well and are unlikely to see again. These relationships thus
require a lower amount of trust.</p>
<p>Communistic relationships include any relationship that can be
explained according to the principle "to each according to their needs,
from each according to their abilities." Graeber argues that most human
relationships between friends and family fall into this category. He
also argues that all human sociability is underpinned by a kind of <a
href="everyday%20communism.html">everyday communism</a> where ordinary
people trust each other and operate according to this principle. It is
important to note that Graeber distinguishes this communism from the
capital C communism of states such as the USSR and the PRC. Graeber's
everyday communism says nothing about property law. It is simply any
relationship defined by the principle stated above.</p>
<p>Relationships of hierarchy are those where one party has immense
power over the other. In hierarchical relationships, debt as a concept
does not make sense as one party is not equal to another. A person
cannot be said to have a debt to a king or a god. 1. No-one has anything
the king wants as the king owns anything he wants. Its dangerous to have
something that the king doesn't have as this threatens the power of the
king. Having something valuable that the king doesn't is a good way to
end up dead. Similarly, a god is all powerful. It can have anything it
desires. A debt to a king or a god isn't really a debt, its a demand. A
debt from a king to a subject isn't a debt, its a gift. Gifts given to
kings are dangerous from another standpoint as they are not taken to be
gifts but rather as a mark of the ongoing social relationships between
king and subject. If you give a king a gift, you will be expected to
give that same gift next year.</p>
<h2 id="what-money-is">What money is</h2>
<p>Money is a promise that we make to each other. If we can make these
promised we could just as easily make different ones.</p>
<p>Money is an impersonal, quantifiable, transferable debt.</p>
