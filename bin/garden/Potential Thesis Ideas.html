<h1 id="brief">Brief</h1>
<p>My thesis will be an investigation into designing creative tools and
experiences for young people in a way that fosters community and aims to
be sustainable and just. I will experiment with various design practices
influenced by nomadic practices, speculative design, and generative
justice.</p>
<p>Although the exact form of any resulting artifacts will be determined
by the design process, I plan to explore the interaction language of
video games as a way of making multimedia performances. I plan to
explore software design methods that attempt to ensure that the
resulting tools I will research cultures of perma-computing and software
preservation to search for methods of writing software that do not feed
cycles of planned or perceived obsolescence. I plan to work with the
Neutral Zone both to get help from teens in designing meaningful
experiences but also to benefit the Neutral Zone community.</p>

<h3 id="questions">questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>what does a sustainable/ecologically sound music technology look
like?</li>
<li>can it be constructed inside dominant economic, social, political,
and cultural paradigms? If not, what frameworks could support its
growth? How could these alternative systems survive inside the dominant
one?</li>
<li>using Eglash's framework: how can music technology circulate (as
opposed to extract) multiple kinds of value (cultural, economic,
ecological)? To what extent can is extricate itself from extractive
enterprises (IC manufacture, mining, inhumane labor conditions,
coercion)</li>
<li>Eglash supposes that enterprises can gradually extricate themselves
from extractive systems by networking with other non-extractive systems,
what are examples of such networks?</li>
</ul>

on what a project exploring multiple of these directions looks like</h3>
<ol>
<li>it would be simple and not try to do too many things (a simple
system that works)</li>
<li>it would take some incremental step towards multiple of the above
directions (I realize there is tension with point 1 here)</li>
<li>it would prefigure a less extractive model</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="synthetic-gamelon-inspired-synthesizers">synthetic gamelon
inspired synthesizers</h4>
<p>I love that the gamelon is not an instrument but an ensemble to which
instruments belong. The reyong player does not walk to the next town and
take their instrument to play with another band. Rather, the reyong is
tuned so that it matches with the ensemble and the ensemble belongs to
the village center. What would this look like with electronic
instruments? On the face of it, this formulation of community ownership
of the technology seems better suited toward sustainable and
non-extractive systems. Would there be a way to support this kind of
community musicing with synthesizers? This question makes me think of
Peter Blasser's wild and wonderful instruments. Specifically the tocante
are tuned based on standard component ranges of resistors and
capacitors, with each tocante tuned differently. What if one used a
similar idea of hyper local tuning scheme to create a group of synthetic
instruments that each had a separate role in the music? If not tuning,
perhaps some other characteristic that binds the instruments locally.
Perhaps these instruments could be modeled off of existing gamelon and
gamelon composers could be commissioned to write pieces for the new
instruments (collab with Gavin).</p>
<h4 id="a-simple-virtual-machine-for-dspaudio-visual-art">A simple
virtual machine for dsp/audio-visual art</h4>
<p>Taking a cue from 100r and the software preservation studies they are
interested in create a small virtual machine that could be implemented
in 2-3 weeks by one developer and the specifications for which could be
written in a few pages printed out or at least a <em>small</em>
book.</p>
<p>Try to wring as much interesting synthesis and pattern manipulation
as possible out of limited specs. Target a machine that is 10 years
old.</p>
<p>Have slightly higher specs than UXN so that more DSP can be done.
(see <a
href="Minimum%20requirements:%20Ableton%20Live%201.5.md.html">specs for
abelton live 2</a>)</p>
<h4 id="a-custom-livecoding-languageinterface">a custom livecoding
language/interface</h4>
<p>I very much want to learn how to make my own livecoding language.
Why? There are so many good ones available. Making music algorithmically
always feels very personal for me. I often enjoy other languages but
feel like I quickly begin customizing or pushing their boundaries. This
may be a personality trait but I think it is also an indicator that
there is something I want to find a more fluid expression for. A list of
things I commonly want to explore: - feedback and non-linearity -
gesture based livecoding with a pen - gesture based livecoding with a
motion sensor - speech based livecoding - the (permeable) boundary
between pattern, composition, and synthesis - dance music - "growth
based" exploration vs. "production based" exploration - algorithmic
pattern</p>
<p>Many languages afford one or more of these areas to be freely
explored but I have not found any fully satisfying.</p>
