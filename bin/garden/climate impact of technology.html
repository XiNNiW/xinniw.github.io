<h1 id="the-climate-impact-of-high-tech">The Climate Impact of
High-Tech</h1>
<p>Technology often has the outward appearance of cleanliness and is
marketed in a way as to make it appear free from ecological
consequence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, almost all parts of computing involve negative impact
on the climate crisis.</p>
<h2 id="supply-chain">supply chain</h2>
<p>The production of digital memory and processors require the
acquisition of rare and difficult to mine materials. Mining, producing,
and shipping these components has a large carbon footprint.(TODO
source)</p>
<h2 id="forced-obsolescence">forced obsolescence</h2>
<p>If the carbon footprint of component construction cannot be avoided,
we should try to reuse and repair our technology as much as possible as
opposed to buying new devices. This is made increasingly difficult by
technology companies that wish to secure a continuous source of revenue
from the consumer. Laptops and smartphones are increasingly difficult to
repair and manufactures are increasingly reticent to assist with repair.
Some have become openly hostile toward individuals attempting to repair
their technology. For example, Apple has, on multiple occasions, <a
href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3yadk/apple-sued-an-independent-iphone-repair-shop-owner-and-lost">sued</a>
individuals for repairing Apple laptops and phones. Apple also has
purposefully rendered products with after-market repair <a
href="https://www.wired.com/2016/02/apple-shouldnt-get-to-brick-your-iphone-because-you-fixed-it-yourself/.html">inoperable</a>.
I don't mean to pick on apple, this kind of anti-competitive behavior is
the norm.</p>
<p>Waiting for the hardware to fail takes too long. Tech companies can
secure revenue more quickly by making their software more demanding over
time. This renders perfectly good devices inoperable as updates to the
operating system, or the software that runs on it become incompatible
and/or non-performant. (see: <a href="Wirth&#39;s%20Law.html">Wirth's
Law</a>) Additionally, the culture surrounding tech emphasizes the new
and generally suspects the old.</p>
<p>As computers are embedded into more and more things (eg "smart" TV,
appliances, tractors, cars, ect..), software can render more and more
consumer goods unusable over time and a faster and more controllable
interval. (TODO source)</p>
<p>This can boost corporate revenue at great cost to the consumer and to
the planet.</p>
<p>The main response from large manufacturers like Apple has been to
promise improvements to their inadequate recycling infrastructure, and
to mount legal resistance to the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_right_to_repair.html">right
to repair</a> movement.</p>
<h2 id="power-consumption">power consumption</h2>
<p>Computers use a lot of <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/11/tsunami-of-data-could-consume-fifth-global-electricity-by-2025.html">power</a>.
The modern internet with its endless feeds, streaming content, and
feature rich front-ends gave rise to "cloud" infrastructure. Cloud
computing is nothing more than enormous redundant data centers where
servers are shared among many tenants. These data centers consume a lot
of power. As our technology becomes more feature rich (read: slower) and
networked demands more ubiquitous (eg. ~<sub>dumb</sub>~ Smart Devices
and the internet of ~<sub>sh*t</sub>~ things) its power demands become
every higher. This can even out revenue at great cost to the consumer
and to the planet.</p>

The modern internet with its endless feeds, streaming content, and
feature rich front end was enabled by the rise of "cloud"
infrastructure. Cloud computing is nothing more than enormous redundant
data centers where servers are shared among many tenants. These data
centers are always on and consume a lot of power. As our technology
becomes more feature rich and networked demands more ubiquitous (eg.
Smart devices and the internet of things), its power demands become
every higher. (TODO source)</p>
<h2 id="system-cost">system cost</h2>
<p>Even if you are able to source your energy from renewable means,
there is no guarantee that the cloud infrastructure that your are forced
to interact with will. Even if every part of the cloud infrastructure
you interact with sources its power from renewable means, the system
overall is consuming power budget that could have gone to other
purposes. Also, the embodied carbon cost of the massive amount of
equipment required to maintain the infrastructure is, on its own,
untenable. (TODO source)</p>
<h2 id="solutions">solutions</h2>
<p>The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_right_to_repair.html">Right
to repair</a> movement has sought to combat the practices of
manufacturers to force the obsolescence of their products.</p>
<p>The advent of open source hardware has created basic opportunities
for startups and communities that prioritize repairable and modular
computers (eg. <a href="https://mntmn.com/">MTN Reform</a>, <a
href="https://frame.work/">Framework laptop</a>, <a
href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/">Fairphone</a>), as well as longer
lasting compatibility for operating systems and software(eg. <a
href="https://xubuntu.org/">Lightweight linux distributions</a>, <a
href="https://lineageos.org/.html">lineage OS</a>)</p>
<p>This effort is mirrored by software developers, artists, and
designers working to create simpler, more performant, and more resilient
software and operating systems. (eg. <a
href="https://100r.co/site/home.html">100 rabbits'</a> <a
href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html">UXN</a>, <a
href="https://collapseos.org/.html">Collapse OS</a>) Many of these
efforts have the additional goal of creating technology that would be
functional and useful in the event of the collapse of the global supply
chain and the failure of global economic forces.</p>
<p>The idea of <a href="computing%20within%20limits">computing within
limits</a> and <a href="permacomputing.html">permacomputing</a> also
explicitly propose ways to mitigate the climate impact of tech.</p>
