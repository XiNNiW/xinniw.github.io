<h1 id="bullshit-jobs">Bullshit Jobs</h1>
<p>:cc0: A Bullshit Job is defined by [[David Graeber]] in his 2018 book
<em>Bullshit Jobs: A Theory</em> as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless,
unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its
existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the
employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Graeber makes some back of the envelope arguments that a staggeringly
high percentage of jobs in developed western countries are
<em>Bullshit</em> by this definition and that this sector of
<em>bullshit</em> work has been steadily growing since the mid-century.
The paradox this raises is as follows: You would expect pointless
employment in the historical Soviet Union as full employment was part of
a federal program. How is it that a Capitalist economy, which is
supposedly focused on efficiency and production, is systematically
wasting resources this way? Graeber argues that are current regime of
employment doesn't resemble classical capitalism so much as
<em>Managerial Feudalism</em>. Like a feudal lord, a big shot CEO or VP
can demonstrates their status by keeping a magnificent array of
flunkies. The more flunkies that such a manager possesses, the more
magnificent they must be. Graeber argues that bullshit work has
proliferated with the rise of the so called FIRE sector (Finance.
Insurance. Real Estate), and the corporatization/professionalization of
the administrative aspects of Non-profits, Universities, and Hospitals.
The bullshit job is not benign and is responsible for draining the
productivity out of the economy. Each of these flunkies has to justify
their existence. They often do this by creating more paperwork for
everyone else to fill out and contributes to a massive increase in
bureaucracy. Meanwhile, while so many people are working 50-60 hour
weeks at their bullshit job, entire industries have formed around the
premise that people are too busy to take care of themselves. Graeber
calls these 2nd order bullshit jobs. The all night pizza delivery
services, meal kits, and dog walkers would simply not be necessary if
people were not wasting their lives pointlessly employed. Moreover, the
bullshit job is often harmful to the person it employs. Graeber coins
the word "Spiritual Violence" to describe the psychological harm inherit
in being forces to do a pointless task all while pretending to everyone
that it is terribly important. He argues that this contributes to
sadomasochistic behaviors in the workplace and to jealousy toward those
whose work has a purpose. Graeber points out that, with few exceptions,
the more a job tangibly helps someone, the less our society is willing
to compensate a person for doing it. Teachers, nurses, and social
workers are among the lowest paid professions while corporate lawyers,
advertising executives, executive vice-provosts, and corporate vision
directors are highly compensated. Those employed in these bullshit
professions form a somewhat cohesive social class that Graeber terms the
<em>Administrative Class</em>. The traditionally left leaning political
parties in countries like the United States and the UK have failed to
mount a critique of bullshit work as a large part of their constituency
is comprised of this <em>Administrative Class</em>. For example, the
nurses union represents both the nurses and the health care
administrators. This creates internal conflict that is impossible to
resolve. ...This bullshit economy maintains itself, in part, because it
engenders attitudes that benefit the very wealthy and powerful...
Graeber argues that ending bullshit work and redefining the value of
employment is incredibly important to our survival as we face dual
climate and ecological crises. Our focus on production, and our
insistence on so much meaningless production for the sake of maintaining
bullshit work, is causing enormous ecological damage. Instead of valuing
productive work, we should value caring work. Task that have
historically been thought of as "women's work", (caring for children and
the elderly, educating, social work, cooking, cleaning, ect... ) should
be the most valued as they are the most needed. Graeber argues that
[[Universal Basic Income]], pared with universal health care and other
social safety nets are an important step in bringing about this shift in
our conception of labor and in eliminating bullshit jobs. Access to UBI
would enable the abused bullshit worker to quit their job without dire
consequences. Similarly, those interested in pursuing work that provides
meaningful care for others would not need to face financial hardship due
to that work being poorly compensated. For many engaged in bullshit
work, doing anything else would likely by a net benefit to society. For
example, if all corporate lawyers were to instead become poets (even bad
poets), society on the whole would likely be a better place for ordinary
people to live.</p>
