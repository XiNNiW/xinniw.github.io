<h3 id="resonance-fm-interview">Resonance FM interview:</h3>
<ul>
<li>research project - looking at weaving as a technical mode of
existence. Looking at ancient weaving as being a technology. Looking at
ancient weaving patterns as a technology. So much of algorithmic music
is based on really recent history... its good to get a more culturally
grounded view.... interference patterns... amazing properties... beyond
a metaphor - computation is a kind of weaving</li>
<li>Dave Griffiths - work for the ZX spectrum chip... low level
operation are things like shifting, combining, multiply in binary...
these are pattern elements very similar to weaving... ups and downs
instead of 1s and 0s... to create something much greater than the sum of
its parts... this approach to patterns making runs through human
history.... currently learning konnokol... vc mdjsifj talks about coming
to complexity through simple ways of exploring rhythms... its nice to
embrace as an alogrithmic musician... what your doing is very
simple</li>
<li>algorithmic composition - different ways of describing algo music...
I've always been a bit unsatisfied with how its usually described...
there are always the same touch points... john cage (dice)... brian
eno... steve reich... those are 2 interesting starting points... random
numbers... and phase patterns... a way to have repetition that take a
long time to reach resolution.... to me these are both kinds of
patterns... one is glitch (breaking of pattern) one is a kind of
weaving.... if we rely on randomness for change but if we have too much
randomness it doesn't change... in practice white noise is
static....where algorithmic composition gets interesting is where you
embrace symmetry... at multiple scales... poly meter... combining
things... fundamental definition of composition... when your working
with algorithms there is a huge world to explore...synonymous with
pattern making... its a way of looking at composition... you could apply
it to any kind of composition (pen and paper)... there is something
special about thinking about the higher level structure... its a trade
off... im jealous of percussionists who can hit something and then
change their minds right away... you get distance from the notes... in
traditional scores you don't get this.... AC is stepping back from
that... a notation that is about higherlevel structure rather than
individual sounds.... a trade off... you open yourself up to surprise bc
you are working with a higherlevel, almost chaotic notation... any
approximation of the notation gives you a very different result
(chaos)... it becomes less about the code and more about listening to
the results... as you are writing it, you are hearing the results...
once you feel what thats doing, its possible to read what you have
written in the context of the music... code doesn't describe music it
describes how to make it... walking the footsteps of morton feldman...
disinterest in the status quo of how music is notated (in the west)...
interested in other ways of doing it... we are stuck in the idea of
music as being a notated form that describes the notes... its really
limiting to me...</li>
<li>cult of the written score - I don't read so I'm criticizing
something that I don't understand... but its interesting how much
pushback you get... there is a whole institutional framework protecting
it. I can understand how writing music down supports interesting ways of
change... if you write it down you can write other pieces based on
it...</li>
<li>Live coding - usually in front of an audience... screen projected
behind them... writing code to make music live... not about the notation
but how its changes... blank editor at the beginning and the end...
reacting to the audience... sometimes it crashes... it becomes more like
speech because (even though its written and formal) you write and
manipulate it live... its more of an oral tradition... people in the
audience might be livecoders who could use bits of what your writing...
some livecoders come with with ready made tracks that they manipulate...
but i like a really hands on improvised approach</li>
<li>algorave - 10 years ago... i had been making algorithmic dance music
since the year 2000... 2012 when we put a name on it... i was living in
london doing an event called dorkbot... electronic art meeting... I
really like how that worked... people just go and show their electric
and electronic art subheaders (people doing strange things with
electricity).. i really liked it ... it was international... it wasn't
centrally controlled... it was called dorkbot so you couldn't go to one
and take yourself seriously which was really important to me at the
time... we were making it more of a thing... naming it was all it took
really... in rave you don't foreground the performer... its about the
crowd enjoying themselves... we put on lots of events and people started
doing things... strong livecoding scene in mexico city... algoraves and
algorumba... its spread around the world and changed as it spread...
some places its nocompleit some places more organized... gave it a name
and it became real ... I wouldn't claim algorave is anything new... we
are sitting in sheffield which is the home of warp records... people
like autechre, mark fell... what algorave contributes is an event that
focuses on the algorithmic aspect... its nice having this event or
culture where algorithmic music is the event.. the thing you go there
for.. what happens when code becomes embedded in the culture... if you
go to a knitting circle you see bits of code everywhere.. why don't we
see that in music... it can be distracting... i don't read the code when
i'm watching a live coder...</li>
<li>livecoding - when the coder runs something it flashes... seeing
decision points... making them visible builds connections with the
audience... when this came about there was a standard way of performing
where you sit at a desk and stare at a screen... this was set up as an
alternative... its definitely not a panacea... I like having a small
projection or having people look over my shoulder...</li>
<li>dancing is a way of thinking - if your dancing you can comprehend
more complex music</li>
<li>tidalcycles - language is really good for combining things together
at a high level.. I'm using language to combine musical ideas together
and I find that really fun... relationship between determinism and
predictability... its deterministic but the results of combination are
complex... its hard to predict... its about unpredictability exploration
creativity...</li>
<li>beginnings - generative manifesto... super inspired by autechre...
warp records... (like really inspired...) ... i got intro it by
listening to electronic music... going to parties... idea of a
programmer who is creative and makes all their own stuff... at the time
the idea of a computer programmer being creative was a joke... so i
wanted to push back... we wanted to make interfaces for ourselves to use
but share what we were doing...</li>
<li>UK RA future leaders fellowship - algorithmic pattern project - 4-7
year project full time... its fundamental research looking at
algorithmic patterns... hosted by then try this... (non-profit)... small
open access open source organization... looking at pattern in weaving,
juggling, architecture... looking for ways these heritage algorithms can
inform new tech... out current view of tech is based off of cold ware
military tech... but there is another tradition of computation that is
based in weaving that is more grounded, open to possibility and
change... working with Kate Sicchio... robot dance notation...
algorithmic pattern for dance... incan knots for keeping track of
numbers... paula minya sound artist using kipu in her work... hoping to
work with her on textile based programming languages where you write
code by tying knots in string...</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kate-siccio-and-alex-icli--">Kate Siccio and Alex ICLI -</h3>
<ul>
<li>pattern is pejorative but we embrace it ---
<ul>
<li>repetition</li>
<li>symmetry/and breaking symmetry</li>
<li>interference/combination/layering... scale</li>
</ul></li>
<li>VC manjuneth - if your a musician trying to work in complexities
your a failure
<ul>
<li>as an artist you should always be working with very simple
ideas</li>
<li>for the audience it can be complex.. but for the artist simple</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sicchio - one gesture can become a composition by repeating a
pattern</li>
<li>McLean - everything we have said about pattern could apply to
computation... pattern and computation are the same thing</li>
<li>Sicchio - what about error and pattern... McLean error is the
feeling when a pattern in broken ... you notice it when it breaks</li>
<li>Sicchio - somatic practices where you move with pattern and correct
abad habits in your body... the body is already full of errors and we
need</li>
<li>Sicchio writes code for humans to execute... if you ask a human to
do somthing impossible they will still do somthing... they may ignore
your... one dancer grabbed th e mic and started giving their own
instructions... humans have agency... this was an interesting error
(moment of anarchy)</li>
<li>Sicchio - robots --- covid has shifted how we work with humans in
the room... robotics needs dance... you start from a blank slate with a
robot... dancers are good at giving instructions for movement... systems
need my expertise as a dancer.. instructions, rulesets, and algorithms
for robot dance... their errors are more predictable..</li>
<li>McLean - computation needs weaving not the other way around...
computer programoing needs help from older crafts like textiles</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="alex-mclean-antonio-roberts-abhinay-khoparzi-and-melody-loveless">Alex
McLean, Antonio Roberts, Abhinay Khoparzi and Melody Loveless</h3>
<ul>
<li>Roberts - Algorave</li>
<li>Loveless - started Codie with Kate Sicchio ... live codes solo with
live singing</li>
<li>Khoparzi - from north of india... algorave india started 3 years
ago.. plays in network bands --- supercontinent (japan , hamilton).. we
practice every week... a band with a person in argentina - the rest are
from south east asia</li>
<li>McLean - livecoding since 2003 -- organized lots of algoraves...
algomech festival - recently working on connections with algorithmic
music and weaving... the first algorave between london and sheffield...
the first one was really cold and no-one danced.... this was a way to
get people to dance to the music... in acedemia they dont dance... we
made a label called chord punch to make this music and not a research
interest... in the end it was making up a dorky word that got people
doing it...</li>
<li>Loveless - teaches livecoding at NYU.. the first day of class we
look at other people discussing it and demonstrate that there is no one
way to do it... "live coding is the act of maniputlating algorithms in
real time to change music or visuals"</li>
<li>Khoparzi - we are writing words on a screen that can be interepreted
by computers or humans they could be messages... the way I use it is a
way of getting folks interested in algorithmic art... the concept if you
know programming your working for corporate software dev makign big
bucks... the way I have engaged with it as a way of expanding my
practice... doing repetitive tasks better.. but it also lets you break
out of patterns ... as technical people we get fixated on even numbers
and lines.. we want it to fix in to visual structures... livecoding you
are always trying to humanize it... live coding is a way of talking and
communicating with folks</li>
<li>Roberts - im not a programmer... live coding give me instantaneous
feedback of it all ... its very intentional typing... i want to type
these words at this time to get this kind of feedback from the
audience.. for me to be a thing in my life and work doing all these
events makes it a real thing for me... when the other people aren't
there... the algorave is what live coding is for me...</li>
<li>McLean- its nice to define livecoding as a kind of situation - music
or visuals coming out.. person typing ... a configuration of people and
technology... i like that its open and continually changing itself...
its a way of communicating and expressing yourself. ... programming is
part of the program... usually these are separated... the program can
change at any moment because you are writing it.. you are also being
changed by the program... its a feedback process of creativity... it
makes it a 2 way communication... its a negotiation where you are
listening -how does live coding feel?</li>
<li>Loveless - i didn;t like it at first... i come out of classical
music so i was jugemental coming in.. there are negative thought about
certain kinds of music in that community ... but then i realized it was
process music.... Its using communication to explore somthing visual or
sound based which it really interesting</li>
<li>Roberts - is it stressful or high energy? I like high pressure
situations.. i have to make all these decisions... if I run this code
will my computer crash... when I do it i feel sweaty and shaky... i
don't come from a music background... i listen to it... I'm aware of the
stigma around electronic music ... there is so much that can go
wrong</li>
<li>Khoparzi - it used to be mostly people standing around... because we
were not showing what were doing... harder sounds breakcore... happended
to be in UK and saw livecoding as a way of making it
visuble/understandable... if it breaks it becomes this kind of
improvisational theater. -Roberts - what about music genres? what is
everyone making?</li>
<li>McLean- im making electronic music but I freely collaborate with
percussionists... drum machine players... collaborating is really
nice... I'm curious what its like to collaborate over networks? Super
Continent, Codie?</li>
<li>Loveless - Katlin and Sarah are elsewhere... sunday morning we 'go
to church' and make music together over a secure vpn using Troop... we
are doing more with synchronisation between machine and live human</li>
<li>Khoparzi - with algorave india ... i come from a percussion
background.. I navigate around my collaborators taking turns who is
going to be weird and who is going to keep the beat... for
Supercontinent we have strategies for rehearsing... anihilation where we
make anihilation sounds... virus where take sounds from each other and
mutate them... i take vocal chops from one artist and im dong some
microsound things with it.. I like about integrating different systems
and see what comes out...</li>
<li>Roberts - i like the idea of annihilation</li>
<li>Roberts - My collaboration with Maria - Bad Circulation ... we are
both in the same city but with the pandemic we had to collaborate
online... livecoding is part of the programming world... So many
livecoders are also percussionists... I'm drawn toward percussion...
everyone takes on roles.. we each have sounds that we like. browser
tools... its not like we are typing more things... Startign up a scene
in your local city</li>
<li>McLean - anyone is free to make an algorave... you can get logos
online.. there are guidelines...avoiding hierarchies.. setting up a
meetup..</li>
<li>Loveless - ramsey nassar, sichhio, others started livecode NYC ..
there is a very active discord.. so many shows happening... I'm lucky to
be in a place where there are so many shows... there was once a week for
a while... Dan Gorlick goes and travels he is organizign one in
california... if you are trying to organize one where you are, then
don't make it all about livecoding... I love algorave but i want it to
be less special... im interested when its oblitterated in 50 years and
normalized...</li>
<li>Roberts - i used to be curator at a gallery... there is a long
history of heavy metal, industrial... the gallery I worked for took a
chance on it... try to normalize it.. try to do a live coding set in a
"normal" event... there is no algorave company you just build up
interest and go fro there...</li>
<li>Khoparzi - i used algorave as a way to sneak experimental music into
the scene... gigs in bombay... people wouldnt show up... I would throw
in harder sounds... Im from a small town.. Ive had to go to bigger
cities... Bombay... did an all women algorave in New Dehli...
computation_mama she did a lot of work normalizing it and breaking
stereotypes that it has to be about nerdy boys in dark rooms... During
the lockdowns we would do sessions on Jitsi and take up a tool and teach
each other... its less about livecoding and more about spreading the
compuational arts... the idea is to take it to smaller cities... Do you
think livecoding environments lend themselves to different genres..</li>
<li>McLean - I think livecoding environments has a sound... you can work
with it or against it... Algorave doesn't have one genre... we think of
genre as being about the sound but its more about the culture around
it... algorave is more about the culture around it... you could replace
all the sounds...</li>
<li>Khoparzi - yeah we did one with dhol sounds.. we made techno/dance
music and connect it to different ideas.. make ambient... connect it to
modular..</li>
<li>Loveless - I like talking about afordances and classes based on your
tool.. we look at what is easier to set up and what is more difficult to
do... this is interesting to compare for young people... the genre
aspect is social... music is art but also has a function or role... it
is social or for one person.. code and tools are similar... what is
music's role?... in worship, socially, propaganda... that could be fun
to think about .. maybe we will have an answer... there is so much of a
social aspect embedded in algorave....</li>
<li>McLean - its often introduced as something futuristic.. there is a
history of futurism of replacing the past.. which is obviously a facist
ideology... i like the idea of making it less special.. connecting
live-coding with cultural practice.. how do we slow down technology and
bring it into everyday life in a more human way..</li>
<li>Roberts - humans are making computers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hack-circus-podcast">hack circus podcast</h3>
<ul>
<li>McLean - I really enjoyed programming.. the escapism of it.. working
with text.. I'm really interested in computers as language machines...
lucky to grow up in the first internet boom and land a job in
programming easily... I wanted to make music with this thing and have a
social life with it... my friend adrian was making generative music... i
didn't have a computer growing up but my brother had a sinclair
spectrum... when i went to university i did a computing degree... they
had a computing art lab but i wasn't allowed in... I always wondered
what they were doing... I was always interested in making communities
... making bulliten board systems... adrian encouraged me to make music
with code... encouraged me to enter a software art contest... fork bomb
made patterns while it crashed your computer... people dont talk about
software anymore... all apps ...software was a curiotorial fiction...
people wanted there to be software art but it didnt exist... once people
start calling you an artist you can start calling your self an
artists... connect the abstrcat world of language with physical
expressions of music...</li>
<li>I had a guitar growing up... i wanted to play it but i never got on
with it... i fell into playing the same thing over and over again..
there were synthesizers in school.. i would spend all lunchtimes there
remaking blue monday over and over again on a dx7... the only read
experience I have as a musician is writing code to make music...</li>
<li>I went to rough trade in london looking through all the CD's for
algorithmic music... farmers manual, autechre, aphex twin... autechre,
mark fell... are the pioneers here... there are people who did this but
there wasn't a community around it.. the point of it wasn't the code it
was the music which isn't bad... for me its nice to have a community
around the technology.. that what I've tried to do is create a community
around algorithmic music worldwide and creating something like a
scene...</li>
<li>dorkbot - albert, adrian, and i ran dorkbot in london... we didn't
want any one person or venue feeling like they owned it.. very much a
collaboration... moved it around... it was nice to create these things
that seemed like and anarchic thing that just appeared but behind the
scenes there are one or two people organizing things.. dork bot is still
going...</li>
<li>interdicipinary work is not aboutdoing somthing in the middle... its
about creating somthing new in the middle ... it can be frustrating .. i
want to do something in the community but the community doesn't exist
yet so i have to make the community... you go out to do somthing like
make th emusic but you realize that you need to make the software...
then you need to make the computer and sooner or later you find yourself
(shaving the yak)... i think thats a good thing to do a good way to
spend your life...</li>
<li>technology is a fabricated layer on top of what technology is...
technology doesn't mean any thing... its an expression of power.. tech
is elon musk is interested in... thats not what technology is... the
idea of an iphone being advanced even though its only been around for a
tiny bit of time when a loom has been developed for thousands of year...
as soon as there is an expert in it... its just gatekeeping... digital
seems to mean the internet and AI, and internet banking... you can't
come to a definition that makes sense unless you open that... its aout
counting, discrete words... the distinction between analog and digital
fall apart... its a shame that these interesting and useful words get
co-opted into something meaningless.. the idea of traveling concepts...
the idea that ideas move around but actually lose meaning as they
do..</li>
<li>algomech - a digital art festival but without any seamless
approaches.. the idea of seamlessness is a problem in the digital
world... you want to pick apart the seams.. all the work i pick for
algomech has to be shoddy... you need to see the human hand</li>
<li>you cant go to dorkbot and take yourself too seriously</li>
<li>maypole dance... we think we make robots to help us but we actually
end up helping them...when they fall over... we care for them...</li>
<li>music is in a generally inert period of nostalgia... its not even
nostalgia... its hard to imagine something radically different</li>
<li>the art scene isn't supported well by the local government... gives
artist freedom</li>
<li>there is space -- people doing things that don't make very much
money which are the most interesting things...</li>
<li>algorave - stupid enough that people don't take themselves too
seriously... WIRED publish an algorave every 6 years or so saying we are
the future of music... they get the wrong idea..</li>
<li>tidal isn't a recipe.. its about patterns... when you look at how a
computer chip works... it is more in common with a weaving loom that you
might expect... the history of technology is much more about the history
of textiles than you might think.... people immediately think of
jacquard loom (lovelace, babbage)... there is much more history than
that... it was a complete misunderstanding of the connection between ...
mathematics of weaving ... interference of warp and weft... have
something new emerges... interference pattern... inputs -&gt; magic
-&gt; outputs... repeat...</li>
<li>i think about tidal as a language.. you have words and you can
combine them in infinite ways and see meaning in it that wasn't there
before.. its a weird formal language ... when i'm performing i do feel
as though i'm not using my body at all.. i lose a certain physical
sense.. i'm not thinking about the typing... i'm using my ears a lot...
hearing is a sense of touch.. nodding my head... pretty unaware of my
surroundings... i'm aware if people are dancing...</li>
