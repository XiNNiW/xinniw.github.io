<h1 id="bi-notes-on-a-bisexual-revolution">Bi: Notes on a bisexual
revolution</h1>
<p><em>Bi: Notes on a bisexual revolution</em> is a book by Shiri Eisner
about bisexuality. The books writes from a feminist and anarchist
perspective and investigates the roots of biphobia and monosexism. It
takes great care to examine the oppressive structures that affect
bisexuals in context and examines the intersections with gender, race,
and colonialism. In this way the book aims to investigate the
possibility of a <em>radical</em> bisexual politics — one that is
concerned with the roots of oppressive structures.</p>
<h2 id="not-defining-bisexuality">(not) defining bisexuality</h2>
<p>Eisner does not claim to provide an authoritative definition of
Bisexuality. She points out that, to do so would deny the multiplicity
bound up in the experience. She also points out a problematic history of
the work getting defined by people who are not bisexual. She provides
two working definitions that are personally resonant to her: Bisexual as
similar + different and more than one.</p>
<h3 id="similar-different-gender-desire">similar + different gender
desire</h3>
<p>A bisexual is someone who experiences desire for people of a similar
gender to themselves and for people with a different gender than
themselves.</p>
<h3 id="more-than-one">more than one</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“I call myself bisexual because I acknowledge that I have in myself
the potential to be attracted romantically and/or sexually to people of
more than one gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily
in the same way, and not necessarily to the same degree. For me, the bi
in bisexual refers to the potential for attraction to people with
genders similar to and different from my own.” - Robyn Ochs</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="bisexuality-and-gender">bisexuality and gender</h2>
<p>One of the things that I really appreciated about the book is the
care with which Eisner writes about the intersections of bisexuality and
gender. Eisner writes about the unique ways that biphobia and monosexism
are applied based on gender identity. There are chapters describing the
intersections of bisexuality with men, women, and a variety of
transgender identities that fall outside "the gender binary". Eisner
examines bisexuality without cissexist or transphobic language and
writes about transgender and genderqueer perspectives with the benefit
of lived experience.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-4-bisexuality-feminism-and-women">chapter 4: bisexuality
feminism and women</h3>
<p>Eisner refutes notions that bisexuality in women is somehow more
socially acceptable. It is acceptable only on the premise that
bisexuality in women does not actually exist. It is rather assumed that
women are lying about their bisexuality to please straight men. Inherent
in this idea is heterosexism, patriarchy, and the threat of sexual
violence. Indeed bisexual women are fetishized in the hetero cis-male
gaze. Hyper-sexualized attitudes are projected onto bisexual women and
can manifest in the real world with sexual harassment and violence.</p>
<p>Biphobic attitudes often scapegoat bisexual women for the violence
they face. Eisner points out the need to center consent and agency of
bisexual women.</p>
<p>She finds roots of social anxieties about bisexual women in the
threat the female bisexuals pose to patriarchy in the possibility of
choice and the embrace of multiplicity. This is connected to an
overarching theme about the ways in which bisexuality creates "Gender
Trouble".</p>
<h3 id="chapter-5-bisexuality-and-men">chapter 5: bisexuality and
men</h3>
<p>Eisner writes about the way in which patriarchy both benefits and
hurts men by pushing them into the role of the oppressor and denying
their social and emotional needs. Men are expected to dominate and be in
control, to participate in war, sports, and competition, to provide and
be the "breadwinner". They are also expected to be emotionally distant,
to be invulnerable and not cry or show weakness, they are also
sexualized and assumed to be "purely physical" beings who always want
and are ready for sex.They are expected to be straight and to not
embrace any femininity in their appearance or affect. To not meet these
expectations is to have a defective masculinity and looked down on.
These patriarchal exceptions intersect with bisexual in interesting
ways.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Men are expected to be strictly and always heterosexual. As alluded
to above, being gay is one of the most dreaded things that a man might
be suspected of, and is often used as a derogatory term for policing men
who have deviated from the sacred lines of manhood. That said, as
American writer Greta Christina mentions in her blog post “Five Stupid,
Unfair and Sexist Things Expected of Men,” once a man actually comes out
as gay, this message of “[D]on’t be even a little bit gay” is replaced
with “Well ... okay.” More than anything, this tells us that men are
allowed to be monosexual (however begrudgingly in the case of gay men),
but are strictly forbidden from being bisexual. Heterosexuality for men
enforces their compliance with dominant masculinity as well as their
value as human beings. Monosexuality for gay men secures their
masculinity by exhibiting perceived decisiveness and stability.
Bisexuality, however, does not fit together with this framework because
its perceived instability, confusion, and indecisiveness clash with
those values expected of men.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is of little surprise, then, that male bisexuality is constantly
erased and denied. As mentioned in the previous chapter, while the
popular “wisdom” regarding bi women says that “everyone is bisexual,
really,” popular “wisdom” about bi men says that “bisexuals don’t
exist.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bisexuality in men is said not to exist and men who are bisexual are
assumed to <em>actually</em> be gay and lying about it. She describes
the ways in which male bisexuality is medicalized, sexualized, and
denied.</p>
<p>The chapter on Bisexuality and masculinity was particularly useful to
me as I started to realize the connections between internalized shame
that I had been feeling around my bisexuality and these negative
attitudes. In particular, it clarified the roots of a feeling of
falseness that persisted no matter how I identified. I wished for a
scientific determination that could tell me if I was straight or not.
Many of my google searches for information returned information about
disease and speculation on the existence of a male bisexual identity.
This included the infamous "Gay, straight, or lying" study. As an aside:
fuck you Michael J. Bailey. You're a goddamn creep and a hack.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-6-bi-and-trans">chapter 6: bi and trans</h3>
<p>We see the negative stereotypes of bisexuality play out in different
ways for transgender and genderqueer people. In mainstream porn and
media, transgender people are <em>assumed</em> to be bisexual. This
carries similar undertones of threat and violence as it does for
women.</p>
<h4 id="connections-and-intersections">connections and
intersections</h4>
<p>Eisner points out many opportunities for solidarity and shared
struggle. Bisexuality and transgender both subvert binaries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While neither of these identities is automatically subversive
(indeed, many people who identify as bi or trans consciously support
sexual and gender binaries), the response that they cause in society and
culture points to the deep anxieties that they trigger. Bisexuality
raises social anxieties concerning the hierarchical binary of gay and
straight, and transgender raises anxieties concerning the hierarchical
binary of woman and man. As mentioned above, these subversions threaten
to blur—and confound—the “clear cut” borders between oppressor and
oppressed classes. In addition, they also expose the fact that a
hierarchy exists, since by crossing that metaphorical “border,” they
reveal its very existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="the-plight-of-the-bi-trans">the plight of the bi-trans</h4>
<p>Eisner writes from the perspective of a genderqueer bisexual activist
who began her work on bisexuality from within the transgender movement
in Israel/Occupied Palistine. She describes encountering biphobia from
people in the transgender movement and encountering transphobia and
cissexist attitudes in the bisexual movement. While she maintains that
accusations of inherent cisexism in the bisexual identity is
scapegoating and points out the history of bi and trans solidarity, she
criticises the places where the mainstream continues to let down the
transgender community through use cissexist language, exclusion, and
transphobia.</p>
<h1 id="monosexism-and-biphobia">monosexism and biphobia</h1>
<p>Biphobia describes prejudice held by individuals against bisexuals
and is mostly carried out in individual interactions. It is distinct
from homophobia in the sense that there are specific stereotypes and
prejudicial attitudes reserved for bisexuals. For instance, consider
accusations of duplicity, infectiousness, "fence-sitting", greed,
promiscuity. Additionally, the idea that bisexuality doesn't exist and
the idea that bisexuals choose to be straight or gay.</p>
<p>Eisner introduces the term monosexism to describe the overarching
system of power that reproduces these attitudes and erases bisexual
experience.</p>
<h2
id="transcending-myth-busting-and-respectability-politics">transcending
myth-busting and respectability politics</h2>
<p>The typical response to these negative attitudes and stereotypes from
the community is one of "myth-busting" — formulating statements that
negate each accusation. Bisexuals are <em>actually</em> not more likely
to be liars, cheats, promiscuous. They are not more likely to be
non-monogamous, indecisive, or HIV positive, ect... Eisner points out
how this "myth-busting" approach does not challenge the underlying
systems of power that give these accusations weight in an attempt to fit
into the mainstream. What about bisexuals who are non-monogamous,
indecisive, disabled, HIV+, sex-workers, ect... Are they simply
<em>bad</em> bisexuals? Obviously not. Eisner points out that these
negative attitudes provide opportunity for a more radical bisexual
politics to build greater solidarity and challenge the systems of power
that give the attitudes cultural weight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Taken from an epistemological perspective, these stereotypes should
not be taken literally at all, but rather read as metaphors about the
subversive potential of bisexuality. What I mean is that bisexuality as
an idea is something that society finds threatening to its normal order.
This has nothing to do with bisexual individuals. I certainly do not
mean to suggest that being bisexual is subversive or radical in and of
itself (if only it were). Being politically subversive or radical takes
a lot of work, thought, and effort, which a simple identity label is
insufficient to achieve. I also do not mean to set a whole new standard
for bisexual behavior that might alienate large portions of the bisexual
community. And I do not mean to imply that the stereotypes are correct
as far as the personal behavior of bisexual people goes. What I do mean
to do is to examine why society places bisexuality on the side of
anxiety, threat, and subversion. And how can we use these very things to
disrupt social order and create social change?</p>
<p>In so doing, what I’m attempting to do is step away from the binary
discourse of Yes versus No, True versus False, or Good versus Bad, and
open a third, radical choice of transgression, subversion, and
multiplicity. Such a move, in my opinion, is also bisexual in character,
marking a resistance to binaries, a collapse of boundaries, and a
subversion of order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eisner points out that behind each of these attitudes and stereotypes
there are anxieties about the established social order. More powerful
responses that do not seek to sooth these anxieties can be formulated —
challenges to notions of gender normativity, patriarchy, and purity, and
embrace of fluidity, change, multiplicity.</p>
<h1 id="bisexuality-and-privilege">bisexuality and privilege</h1>
<p>Bisexuals are often accused of having heterosexual privilege. Eisner
notes a troubling lack of engagement with this idea both from those that
argue against it and from those who assume it to be true. Eisner finds
the idea that bisexuals carry heterosexual privilege to be suspicious
and counters it with a materialist argument. If the privilege exists
then we should see measurable social advantage for bisexuals over gay
and lesbian identities. This does not bear out in reality. Studies
summarized in the <em>Bisexuality Invisibility Report</em> find that
bisexual people have worse socio-economic outcomes as well as worse
mental and physical health than gay and lesbian people on the whole.</p>
<p>Eisner criticizes the <em>myth-busting</em> approach to the idea of
bisexuals carrying heterosexual privilege and again takes and
epistemological approach. She examines where the idea of bisexuals
having heterosexual privilege comes from and deconstructs the idea with
nuance. She points out that at the heart of the accusation of
heterosexual privilege is a denial of a unique bisexual experience.
Bisexuals are said to be oppressed insofar as they appear to be
homosexual and have privilege insofar as they appear heterosexual. In
reality there are unique problems that bisexual people face by virtue of
them being bisexual.</p>
<p>At the same time she points out that it is true that couples that
appear to be straight will not face harassment in public for their
identity in the same way that visibly queer couples will.</p>
<p>She argues that insofar as bisexuals can be said to have privilege it
is the privilege to pass as straight and that passing is always a double
edged sword.</p>
<p>She also challenges the notion that visibility equals transgression.
She points out discrimination that bisexuals face in both gay and
straight communities without scapegoating gay people. She lays the blame
with heterosexism, patriarchy, cisexism, ect...</p>
